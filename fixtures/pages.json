RGB uses \r\n                additive colour mixing and is the basic colour model used in television \r\n                or any other medium that projects colour with light.

Red and green combine \r\n                to make yellow, green and blue to make cyan, and blue and red \r\n                form magenta.

It is very rare \r\n                that images are taken with the sole intention of producing a &#8216;pretty&#8217; \r\n                colour picture. Most &#8216;pretty pictures&#8217; are constructed \r\n                from data that was acquired to study some physical process, and \r\n                the astronomer herself probably never bothered to assemble the \r\n                greyscale images to a colour image.</p>\r\n              <p><b>Natural colour images</b><br>\r\n                It is possible to create colour images that are close to &#8220;true-colour&#8221; \r\n                if three wide band exposures exist, and if the filters are close \r\n                to the r, g and b receptors in our eyes. Images that approximate \r\n                what a fictitious space traveller would see if he or she actually \r\n                travelled to the object are called &#8220;natural colour&#8221; \r\n                images. </p>\r\n              <p>To make a natural colour image the order of the colours assigned \r\n                to the different exposures should be in &#8220;chromatic order&#8221;, \r\n                i.e. the lowest wavelength should be given a blue hue, the middle \r\n                wavelength a green hue and the highest wavelength should be red.<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p><b>Representative colour images</b><br>\r\n                If one or more of the images in a data set is taken through a \r\n                filter that allows radiation that lies outside the human vision \r\n                span to pass &#8211; i.e. it records radiation invisible to us \r\n                - it is of course not possible to make a natural colour image. \r\n                But it is still possible to make a colour image that shows important \r\n                information about the object. This type of image is called a representative \r\n                colour image. Normally one would assign colours to these exposures \r\n                in chromatic order with blue assigned to the shortest wavelength, \r\n                and red to the longest. In this way it is possible to make colour \r\n                images from electromagnetic radiation far from the human vision \r\n                area, for example x-rays. Most often it is either infrared or \r\n                ultraviolet radiation that is used.</p>\r\n              <p><b>Enhanced colour images</b><br>\r\n                Sometimes there are reasons to not use a chromatic order for an \r\n                image. Often these reasons are purely aesthetic, as is seen in \r\n                the example below. This type of colour image is an enhanced colour \r\n                image.</p>\r\n              <p><b>You are the judge</b><br>\r\n                When processing raw science images one of the biggest problems \r\n                is that, to a large degree, you are &#8216;creating&#8217; the \r\n                image and this means a colossal freedom within a huge parameter \r\n                space. There are literally thousands of sliders, numbers, dials, \r\n                curves etc. to twist and turn.</p>\r\n              <p>Speaking of right and wrong, there really are no wrong or right \r\n                images. There are some fundamental scientific principles that \r\n                should normally be observed, but the rest is a matter of aesthetics \r\n                &#8212; taste. Chromatic ordering of the exposures is one of the \r\n                important scientific principles.</p>\r\n              <p></p>\r\n              <p><b>Stretch function</b><br>\r\n                One particularly important aspect of image processing is the choice \r\n                of the best stretch function. You choose which &#8220;stretch \r\n                function&#8221; or representation to use in the Fits Liberator \r\n                window.</p>\r\n              <p>A logarithmic representation of the pixel values tends to suppress \r\n                the bright parts of the image, i.e. the stars, and to enhance \r\n                the fainter part, e.g. nebulosity. This can be desirable if the \r\n                &#8216;faint stuff&#8217; needs &#8216;a boost&#8217;, but a logarithmic \r\n                stretch function can also reduce the contrast in an image, producing \r\n                a lower dynamic range as is seen in the example below.<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p><br>\r\n                <b>Links</b></p>\r\n              <p><a href=\"http://www.hubblesite.org/sci.d.tech/behind_the_pictures/\">www.hubblesite.org/sci.d.tech/behind_the_pictures</a></p>\r\n              <p><a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/commonpages/infoindex/ourimages/color_comp.html\" target=\"_parent\">heritage.stsci.edu/commonpages/infoindex/<br>\r\n                </a><a href=\"http://heritage.stsci.edu/commonpages/infoindex/ourimages/color_comp.html\" target=\"_parent\">ourimages/color_comp.html</a><br>\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p> ",

The observations are carried out in visible, infrared and ultraviolet light. In many ways Hubble has revolutionised modern astronomy, by not only being an efficient tool for making new discoveries, but also by driving astronomical research in general.</strong></p>\r\n<h2>The mission</h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"/static/about/img/hubble_in_orbit1.jpg\" alt=\"Hubble\" width=\"320\" height=\"289\" hspace=\"10\" vspace=\"10\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" />The Universe is gloriously transparent to visible light over journeys lasting billions of years. However, in the last few microseconds before light arrives at telescope mirrors on Earth it must travel through our turbulent atmosphere and the fine cosmic details become blurred. It is this same atmospheric turbulence that makes the stars appear to twinkle on a dark night.</p>\r\n<p>Putting a telescope in space is one way of evading this problem. As well as collecting visible light from its orbit high above the atmosphere, the Hubble Space Telescope also observes the infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths that are completely filtered out by the atmosphere.</p>\r\n<p>The Hubble Space Telescope, a joint ESA and NASA project, has made some of the most dramatic discoveries in the history of astronomy. From its vantage point 600 km above the Earth, Hubble can detect light with 'eyes' 5 times sharper than the best ground-based telescopes and looks deep into space where some of the most profound mysteries are still buried in the mists of time.</p>\r\n",

Its wavelength range extends from the ultraviolet, through the visible and out to the near-infrared. ACS is a so-called third generation Hubble instrument. Its wide field of view is nearly twice that of Hubble's former workhorse camera, WFPC2, and with its superb image quality and high sensitivity, ACS has increased Hubble's potential for new discoveries by a factor of ten. The name, Advanced Camera for Surveys, comes from its particular ability to map large areas of the sky in great detail. ACS can also perform spectroscopy with a special optical tool called a 'grism'.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h2>Three sub-instruments make up ACS</h2>\r\n\t\t\t<p>The Wide Field Camera is a high efficiency, wide field, optical and near-infrared camera. This space eye is optimised to hunt for galaxies and galaxy clusters in the remote and ancient Universe, at a time when our Cosmos was very young. The distribution in space of these distant objects will enable scientists to investigate just how the Universe evolved.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Another important sub-instrument is the High Resolution Camera. This camera is designed to take extremely detailed pictures (high resolution) of the light from the centres of galaxies with massive black holes, as well as of ordinary galaxies, star clusters and gaseous nebulae, where extraterrestrial planetary systems may be hidden. The instrument includes a coronograph, capable of improving Hubble's contrast near bright objects by about a factor of 10.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Finally, the Solar Blind Camerablocks visible light to allow faint ultraviolet radiation to be discerned. Among other things, it will be used to study weather patterns on other planets and aurorae on Jupiter.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h2>Links</h2>\r\n\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://adcam.pha.jhu.edu/\" title=\"More about ACS\" target=\"_blank\">More about ACS</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t    </ul></td>\r\n\t\t<td width=\"38%\" valign=\"top\"><p><img src=\"/static/about/img/sm3bacs_beforelaunch.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"162\" alt=\"ACS - Hubble's newest scientific instrument on display in a clean-room before launch. \" /></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>ACS - Hubble's newest scientific instrument on display in a clean-room before launch.</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"/static/about/img/ccd-n-labperson.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"250\" alt=\"A look into one of ACS's most delicate and crucial parts - the CCD camera.\" /></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>A look into one of ACS's most delicate and crucial parts - the CCD camera.</em></p></td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n",

Data that today are left nearly unexploited in the \r\n                archives. <br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>The outcome or the products of this work &#8211; all kinds of \r\n                images, illustrations, animations and movies &#8211; would be \r\n                used for educational material and outreach by a) the involved \r\n                European organizations, b) the Lab itself, and c) the press, educators \r\n                and public directly (naturally all free of charge). One could \r\n                imagine a multitude of purposes for the materials: Press releases, \r\n                textbooks, educational programmes, web sites, CD-ROMs, interactive \r\n                kiosks in planetaria, IMAX movies, TV footage etc. etc. </p>\r\n              <p>To put it differently this Lab would be exploiting the vast amounts \r\n                of data from ground and space, which currently are hidden in inaccessible \r\n                data archives, and make them available for Europe&#8217;s press, \r\n                educators and the public &#8211; especially young people.</p>\r\n              <p>There is an obvious link with the Virtual Observatories now under \r\n                construction &#8211; both on the VO &#8216;consumer&#8217; side \r\n                &#8211; benefiting from the VO structures and tools to optimize \r\n                the production of outreach and education material &#8211; and \r\n                from the VO &#8216;producer&#8217; side &#8211; for instance by \r\n                <a href=\"/projects/vo_images/\">making PR images VO compatible</a> \r\n                and thereby usable in a much wider context.</p>\r\n              <p><strong>General aims</strong></p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li> To share the excitement of space with the public </li>\r\n                <li>To encourage the younger generation to pursue science careers</li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p><strong>Specific aims</strong></p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li>To develop innovative methods for visualisation and utilize \r\n                  these in visual and written communication</li>\r\n                <li> To visualize the vast amounts of astronomical data from ground \r\n                  and space</li>\r\n                <li> Disseminate these visualisation products to press, educators \r\n                  and public<br />\r\n                </li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p><strong>Possible implementation</strong><br />\r\n                Some obvious questions for this European Astronomy A/V Lab are:</p>\r\n              <p><strong>Why now?</strong><br />\r\n                1. Europe has never received so much excellent astronomical data \r\n                as now flooding into archives in unrivalled quantities from ground \r\n                and space, and this trend will continue in the future.<br />\r\n                2. We have never had as magnificent technologies for treating \r\n                the data and making them available to laymen.<br />\r\n                3. The public and press have never been as &#8216;hungry&#8217; \r\n                for &#8216;pretty pictures&#8217;, illustrations and animations \r\n                as now.</p>\r\n              <p><strong>Why hasn&#8217;t this been done before?</strong><br />\r\n                For the reasons of complexity explained above there is a definite \r\n                need for a pan-European effort to get above the &#8216;critical \r\n                mass&#8217; for a laboratory such as this. No individual organisation \r\n                would be able to gather the technical, astronomical, communicational \r\n                and graphical know-how necessary. It would need a multi-national \r\n                effort and an effort spanning over the boundaries of organisations \r\n                to take the most exiting and potentially interesting data sets \r\n                and convert them into high-grade existing education and outreach \r\n                products. The advantages of creating a dedicated Laboratory &#8211; \r\n                as opposed to the existing small efforts dispersed all over Europe \r\n                &#8211; are great and would enable the production of unparalleled \r\n                quantities of education and outreach products. </p>\r\n              <p><strong>Duration</strong><br />\r\n                It is foreseen that the effort will need to be sustained to use \r\n                the avalanche of accumulated know-how in the Laboratory and therefore \r\n                need to run over an initial period of 3 to 5 years.</p>\r\n              <p></p>\r\n              <p>&nbsp; </p>\r\n              <p> We welcome collaboration on these issues.

It is impossible to observe them directly, so astronomers had no way to test  their theories until Hubble arrived. </p>\n<p> The high resolution of Hubble made it  possible to see the effects of the gravitational attraction of some of these  objects on their surroundings. Hubble has also proved that black holes are most <a href=\"/news/heic0002/\">likely present  at the centres of all galaxies</a>. This has important implications for the  theories of galaxy formation and evolution.</p>\n<p><br />\n<strong><em>Black holes and the quasar connection</em></strong><br />\r\n  Before Hubble, <a href=\"\">quasars</a> were considered to be isolated star-like objects of a mysterious nature. Hubble  has observed several quasars and found that they all reside at galactic  centres. Today most scientists believe that black holes at the galactic centres  are the &quot;engines&quot; that power the quasars. In the 1950s and 1960s  astronomers had found objects, such as quasars and radio sources, whose energy  output was so immense that it could not be explained by traditional sources of  energy such as that produced by normal stars. It was suggested that their vast  energy output could best be explained if massive black holes were at the  centres of these objects.</p>\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\">\n<tr>\n<td width=\"59%\"><div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/static/archives/images/medium/opo0020a.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"334\" /><br />\n<em>A jet of electrons streaming out from the centre of the galaxy M87</em></div></td>\n<td width=\"41%\"><p>Prior to the launch of Hubble a handful of black hole candidates had been  studied but the limitations of ground based astronomy were such that  irrefutable evidence for their existence could not be obtained. Black holes  themselves, by definition, cannot be observed, since no light can escape from  them. </p>\n<p>However, astronomers can study the effects of black holes on their  surroundings. These include powerful jets of electrons that travel huge  distances, many thousands of light years from the centres of the galaxies.  </p></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p align=\"left\">Matter falling towards a black hole can also be seen emitting bright light  and if the speed of this falling matter can be measured, it is possible to  determine the mass of the black hole itself. This is not an easy task and it  requires the extraordinary capabilities of Hubble to carry out these  sophisticated measurements.<br />\n<br />\r\n  Hubble observations have been fundamental in the study of the <a href=\"/images/opo0020a/\">jets</a> and  discs of matter around a number of black holes. Accurate measurements of the  masses have been possible for the first time. Hubble has found black holes 3  billion times as massive as our Sun at the centre of some galaxies. While this might have been expected, Hubble has surprised everyone by  providing strong evidence that black holes exist at the centres of all  galaxies. Furthermore, as it appears that larger galaxies are the hosts of  larger black holes. There must be some mechanism that links the <a href=\"/news/heic0614/\">formation of the  galaxy</a> to that of its black hole and vice versa. This has profound  implications for theories of galaxy formation and evolution and will certainly  be the subject of considerable additional research with Hubble during the next  decade.</p>\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><p class=\"style2\"><strong>Duccio Macchetto<br />\n</strong>ESA astronomer, Head of the Science Policies Division, STScI</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"7%\"><span class=\"style2\"></span></td>\n<td width=\"86%\"><p class=\"style2\"><em>&quot;Hubble provided strong evidence that all galaxies \r\n\t\t\t\tcontain black holes millions or billions of times \r\n\t\t\t\theavier than our sun.

It was suspected that the quasars reside in galaxies and that the fuzzy patches of light could be those host galaxies. Hubble&rsquo;s high-resolution <a href=\"/about/general/instruments/foc/\">Faint Object Camera</a> images showed with clarity that this is indeed the case. More importantly the hosts of quasars appear to be galaxies of all types, contrary to earlier predictions that favoured the idea that quasars were to be found only in elliptical galaxies. This is important since the light from quasars is believed to be produced by black holes at the centres of their <a href=\"/images/opo0021b/\">host galaxies</a>. Astronomers can now show that this is indeed the case and that quasar host galaxies are the same types of galaxies found in our neighbourhood. This realisation also leads to the question of why most of the nearby galaxies, including our own Milky Way have &lsquo;dormant&rsquo; black holes, namely black holes which are inactive at this time. This will be the subject of new studies with Hubble.</p>\n<p><em><strong>A unifying model</strong></em><br />\r\n  Today most astronomers believe that quasars, radio galaxies and the centres of so-called active galaxies just are different views of more or less the same phenomenon: a black hole with energetic jets beaming out from two sides. When the beam is directed towards us we see the bright lighthouse of a quasar. When the orientation of the system is different we observe it as an active galaxy or a radio galaxy. This &lsquo;unified model&rsquo; has gained considerable support through a number of Hubble observational programs. The simplistic early ideas have however been replaced by a more complex view of this phenomenon &ndash; a view that will continue to evolve in the years to come. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

An analysis of the interviews is carried out, to study how far science communicators in the name of science communication can, or should, push, without damaging the individual, and thus also the collective credibility, of the science communication community and the involved institutions. Overall the study suggests that a credibility problem for astronomical press releases does not exist. However the interviews indicated a problem within the scientific community, where some lack of understanding and respect among the actors is found. All actors though, showed great attention and concern for communicating science in a credible way. A code of conduct presenting guidelines for how to minimize hype in press releases is presented. </p>\r\n              <p>&nbsp; </p>\r\n              <p><strong> Keywords</strong> : credibility, hype, science communication, astronomy, visibility and press releases. </p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li>Report <a href=\"/static/projects/credibility/credibility_report.pdf\">PDF</a> (1 MB) </li>\r\n                <li>Credibility <a href=\"/projects/credibility/credibility_interviews/\">interviews</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href=\"http://www.communicatingastronomy.org/cap2007/proceedings/cap07340345.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Communicating Astronomy witth the Public 2007 conference proceedings (PDF)</a></li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

We                       use IRAF's <a href=\"http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?wmosaic\">Wmosaic</a> task. It corrects for geometric distortion (the camera is                       not exactly aligned with Hubble's optical axis) and rotates,                       offsets and scales the individual images to produce one large                       mosaic image. Furthermore the task dues a pretty good job                       of 'stitching' together the edges (not perfect, but better                       than by hand).</li>\r\n                </ol>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li><strong><a href=\"http://archive.eso.org/dss/dss\">ESO's Digitized                     Sky Survey archive </a> </strong></li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <ol>\r\n                  <li>Type the name of an object in &quot;Object Name:&quot;,                       e.g. M 42</li>\r\n                  <li>Choose image size, measure in arc-minutes or 1/60 degree.

It will  generate a single WFPC2 mosaic'ed file from one WFPC2 file containing  four CCD images in individual planes.<br />\n              </p>\n              <p>Stretch Functions<br />\n                -----------------</p>\n              <p>Users  of version 2.0 of the ESA/ESO/NASA FITS Liberator will find the  interface nearly unchanged. The most signifcant change is to the  stretch function menu:</p>\n              <p>- The functions have been reorganized into more logical groupings</p>\n              <p>- The square and cube root functions have been renamed x^(1/2) and x^(1/3)</p>\n              <p>- Fourth and fifth root functions have been added: x^(1/4), x^(1/5)</p>\n              <p>- New compound functions have been added: ArcSinh(ArcSinh(x)), ArcSinh(x^(1/2))</p>\n              <p>Since  the ArcSinh function is similar in effect to Log, but is well-behaved  around zero it has been promoted to a lead position in the menu.<br />\n              </p>\n              <p>Metadata Pane (FITS Liberator)<br />\n                ------------------------------</p>\n              <p>This  pane in the FITS Liberator interface has been reworked to support  version 1.0 of the Astronomy Visualization Metadata standard. Much of  this work is not directly visible to the user, but reflects updates to  the way the metadata is stored internally.</p>\n              <p>One  benefit to the new data format is that many fields identifying the  creator and content information (contacts, headline, description, etc.)  will also be available under the matching IPTC fields, and thus easily  read within a variety of image processing and cataloging programs that  access these fields. The astronomy-specific fields may not be available  in many other packages at this time, however.</p>\n              <p>Mac  users: Note that you may lose information in the last metadata field in  which you were typing if you click &quot;OK&quot; while the cursor is still  blinking in that field. To keep that infomration, click outside of the  text box before clicking the &quot;OK&quot; button to import the FITS image and  metadata.</p>\n              <p>For more information about the Astronomy Visualization Metadata standard, go to:</p>\n              <p>http://www.communicatingastronomy.org/avm/1.0/<br />\n              </p>\n              <p>Metadata Panels (File Info... Dialog)<br />\n                -------------------------------------</p>\n              <p>New  and improved metadata panels have also been included to allow access to  this metadata through the FIle&gt;File Info... dialog box. These panels  can be installed using a separate application included with the  distribution. They will appear near the top of the list as the panels:</p>\n              <p>Astro Creator<br />\n                Astro Content<br />\n                Astro Observation<br />\n                Astro Coordinates<br />\n                Astro Publisher<br />\n                Astro FITS Liberator</p>\n              <p>The  information can be freely edited in the File Info... dialog box, but  there is limited syntax-checking. Fields that should use only elements  from a controlled vocabulary of a limited number of choices (like  Subject.Category, Spectral.ColorAssignment, etc.) should be entered  carefully. These fields will be restricted to the accepted values if  set using the FITS Liberator plugin.</p>\n              <p>Fields that contain multiple values will be marked with an asterisk. Values should be separated by a semi-colon (&quot;;&quot;) character.</p>\n              <p>Many  fields will keep a history of recently-used values that can simplify  data entry. These show up as pop-up lists via the small triangular icon  at the right side of the text field. </p>\n              <p>Dates should adhere to the following formatting in this dialog box:</p>\n              <p> Astro Content&gt;Date: MM/DD/YYYY (it will display as MM/DD/YY)<br />\n                Astro Observation&gt;Temporal.StartTime: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM</p>\n              <p>Note  that any information that was entered using version 2.0 of the FITS  Liberator will not be accessible once version 2.1 is installed. </p>\n              <p>&nbsp;</p>\n              <p>------------------------------<br />\n                FITS Concatenator Usage Notes<br />\n                ------------------------------</p>\n              <p>The  ESA/ESO/NASA FITS Concatenator script (found under  File&gt;Scripts&gt;FITS Concatenator) is a utility to simplify the  process of combining individual grescale images into a single document.  It does two things:</p>\n              <p> Copy each open image into its own layer</p>\n              <p> Concatenate/Consolidate all of the metadata fields<br />\n                  <br />\n                The script combines ALL open windows and the original images are  closed. Only the combined layered document remains. Note that this can  NOT be undone; it is safer to save all open images before running this  script.</p>\n              <p>There  are several notes/caveats on the way the metadata fields (accessed from  the FITS Liberator Metadata tab or the File&gt;File Info... dialog) are  combined:</p>\n              <p>1. Single-valued fields retain the values from the last file opened.</p>\n              <p>2. Multi-valued fields contain all entries concatenated together.</p>\n              <p>2.1  There is no duplication-checking on entries; identical instances of  e.g. Subject.Name, Subject.Category will appear as duplicates and will  need to be deleted by hand.</p>\n              <p>3. WCS coordinates are taken from the last file opened.</p>\n              <p>3.1 Spatial.Quality is automatically set to &quot;Undefined&quot; as a reminder to revalidate the coordinates after combining images.</p>\n              <p>3.2  Currently the Spatial.CDMatrix field will contain all entried from all  files concatenated together. Only the final four will reflect the same  coordinate solution of the other fields. This will be fixed in a future  release.<br />\n              </p>\n              <p>-----------------------------------<br />\n                Colour Composite Action Usage Notes<br />\n                -----------------------------------</p>\n              <p>A  set of colour utility actions will be installed in Photoshop's Presets  folder. To make them available for use, choose the &quot;Colour_Composite&quot;  selection from the pop-up menu available under the small triangle at  the top of the Actions palette tab. If the Actions palette is not  visible, it can be displayed from the Window Menu.</p>\n              <p>Once selected from the pop-up, three new actions will be added to your actions palette:</p>\n              <p> RED Layer<br />\n                GREEN Layer<br />\n                BLUE Layer</p>\n              <p>These  are shortcuts for assigning colors to a multichannel image. They should  be used on a document with two or more greyscale layers from different  FITS files. This could be the result of running the FITS Concatenator  script on several open windows, or of manually copying layers into a  single document.</p>\n              <p>To use the actions, select a  greyscale layer in the Layer's palette then run one of them (in Button  Mode, this is done with a single click, otherwise you select the action  then click the triangular &quot;Run&quot; button at the bottom of the palette).</p>\n              <p>The  selected layer will be colourized with a grouped Hue/Saturation  adjustment layer. Intervening Levels and Curves will also be added,  allowing quick adjustments. The coluor can be further adjusted by  double-clicking the Hue/Saturation adjustment layer and moving the Hue  slider.<br />\n              </p>\n              <p>----------------<br />\n                WFPC2 Mosaicator<br />\n                ----------------</p>\n              <p>This  utility is only intended for users working with data from the WFPC2  instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope. It takes a FITS file with  four WFPC2 images stored internally as separate image planes and  creates a new FITS file with a single image correctly mosaiced from  these planes.</p>\n              <p>&nbsp;</p>\n              <p>----------------------------<br />\n                Locations of Installed Files<br />\n                ----------------------------</p>\n              <p>Windows<br />\n                -------<br />\n                FitsLiberator2 - User-installed</p>\n              <p>This  will be installed by the Windows installer.

It \n                  shows how the imported image will look with the chosen combination \n                  of Stretch function (8 + 9) and Black/White level (14). The \n                  coloured pixels are due to (6), see this below.</li>\n                <li>You may zoom up to 400% on the preview image, and down to \n                  6.3% (depending on the size of the image). Default is a zoom \n                  factor that lets you view the entire image. </li>\n                <li>Some FITS files have several &quot;Images&quot; embedded or \n                  stacked on top of each other. And some FITS files also have \n                  several &quot;Planes&quot; in them. With this drop-down box \n                  you can select which Image or Plane to work on. If you want \n                  to import more than one Image or Plane you have to open the \n                  file multiple times. Default is Image 1, Plane 1.</li>\n                <li>The &quot;Image statistics&quot; box give you information \n                  about the Dimensions of the image (in pixels), the Minimum and \n                  Maximum pixel values, the Mean and Standard Deviations of the \n                  pixel values. If you move the cursor over the preview you will \n                  get information about the individual pixels (position and value). \n                  The Image Statistics box is updated when you choose another \n                  Stretch function (8).</li>\n                <li>If you want to perform several operations on an image and \n                  work with large images (or a slow computer) you can turn the \n                  preview off, and get all your choices calculated at once when \n                  you are done and click it back on. Default is Preview On.</li>\n                <li>You have a choice of getting three special types of pixel \n                  values marked individually with each their colour: Undefined \n                  values, White clipped values and Black clipped values.\n                  <ul>\n                      <li>Undefined values are both so-called NULL values and 'real' \n                        undefined values. NULL values are values that are blank \n                        in the original FITS file. Undefined values are values that \n                        become undefined due to mathematical problems (e.g. division \n                        by zero) in the calculation of stretch function etc. Having \n                        these values marked is important as too many undefined pixels \n                        makes an image look less attractive.</li>\n                    <li>White clipped pixels are pixels that are completely white. \n                      You can adjust their number using the White level slider \n                      (14). </li>\n                    <li>Black clipped pixels are pixels that are completely black. \n                      You can adjust their number using the Black level slider \n                      (14). </li>\n                  </ul>\n                </li>\n                <li>You have a choice of scaling the graphical viewing of the \n                  histogram values (12) in Logarithmic was (default) or linear. \n                  Logarithmic usually gives the best overview as the number of \n                  pixels with certain intensities vary a lot.</li>\n                <li>The stretch function is the 'mapping' of your input image \n                  to the output image. The default is Linear and this maps the \n                  input image to the output image directly 1:1 without changing \n                  anything. If you apply for instance a logarithm the fainter \n                  areas of the input image gets enhanced.</li>\n                <li> The value a is a constant that offsets the image values. \n                  This can be important when you use a logarithmic stretch as \n                  Log for instance does not work on negative pixel values.</li>\n                <li>You can choose to import the image as an 8-bit image (256 \n                  greyscales) or a 16 bit image (65536 greyscales).

A man who eventually broke the promise made to his father and followed the path dictated by his passion.</p>\r\n<p>As a result of Hubble's work, our perception of mankind's place in the Universe has changed forever: humans have once again been set aside from the centre of the Universe. When scientists decided to name the Space Telescope after the founder of modern cosmology the choice could not have been more appropriate.</p>\r\n<h2>A promising student</h2>\r\n<p>Edwin Hubble was born in Missouri in 1889, the son of an insurance executive, and moved to Chicago nine years later. At his high school graduation in 1906, the principal said: <em>&quot;Edwin Hubble, I have watched you for four years and I have never seen you study for ten minutes.&quot; </em>He paused, leaving young Edwin on tenterhooks a moment longer, before continuing: <em>&quot;Here is a scholarship for the University of Chicago.&quot;</em></p>\r\n<p>This high school scholarship was also awarded to another student by mistake, so the money had to be halved and Edwin had to supply the rest. He paid his expenses by tutoring, working in the summer and, in his junior year, by obtaining a scholarship in physics and working as a laboratory assistant. He finally obtained a degree in Mathematics and Astronomy in 1910.</p>\r\n<h2>The Rhodes scholar</h2>\r\n<p>A tall, powerfully built young man, Hubble loved basketball and boxing, and the combination of athletic prowess and academic ability earned him a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford. There, a promise made to his dying father, who never accepted Edwin's infatuation for astronomy, led him to study law rather than science, although he also took up Literature and Spanish.</p>\r\n<p>He studied Roman and English Law at Oxford and returned to the United States only in 1913. Here he passed the bar examination and practised law half-heartedly for a year in Kentucky, where his family was then living.</p>\r\n<h2>The beloved high school teacher and coach</h2>\r\n<p>He was also hired by New Albany High School (New Albany, Indiana) in the autumn of 1913 to teach Spanish, Physics and Mathematics, and to coach basketball. His popularity as a teacher is recorded in the school yearbook dedicated to him: <em>&quot;To our beloved teacher of Spanish and Physics, who has been a loyal friend to us in our senior year, ever willing to cheer and help us both in school and on the field, we, the class of 1914, lovingly dedicate this book.&quot;</em></p>\r\n<p>When the school term ended in May 1914, Hubble decided to pursue his first passion and so returned to university as a graduate student to study more astronomy.</p>\r\n<h2>A new era for astronomy begins</h2>\r\n<p>The famous British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking wrote in his book A Brief History of Time that Hubble's <em>&quot;discovery that the Universe is expanding was one of the great intellectual revolutions of the 20th century.&quot;</em> Who could have guessed such a future for Edwin when he began his PhD in Astronomy at Chicago University in 1914?</p>\r\n<h2>War postpones Hubble's astronomical debut</h2>\r\n<p>Early in 1917, while still finishing the work for his doctorate, Hubble was invited by George Ellery Hale, founder of the Mount Wilson Observatory, in Pasadena, California, to join the staff there. This was a great opportunity, but it came in April of a dreadful year. After sitting up all night to finish his PhD thesis and taking the oral examination the next morning, Hubble enlisted in the infantry and telegraphed Hale:<em>&quot;Regret cannot accept your invitation. Am off to the war.&quot;</em></p>\r\n<p>He served in France and next returned to the United States in 1919. He went immediately to the Mount Wilson Observatory, where the newly discharged Major Hubble, as he invariably introduced himself, arrived, still in uniform, but ready to start observing.</p>\r\n<p>Hubble was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time. Mount Wilson was the centre of observational work underpinning the new astrophysics, later called cosmology, and the 100-inch Hooker Telescope, then the most powerful on Earth, had just been completed and installed after nearly a decade of work.</p>\r\n<p>On the mountain Hubble encountered his greatest scientific rival, Harlow Shapley, who had already made his reputation by measuring the size of the Milky Way, our own Galaxy. Shapley had used a method pioneered by Henrietta Leavitt at the Harvard College Observatory that relied on the behaviour of standardised light variations from bright stars called Cepheid variables to establish the distance of an object.</p>\r\n<p>His result of 300 000 light-years for the width of the galaxy was roughly 10 times the previously accepted value. However Shapley, like most astronomers of the time, still thought that the Milky Way was all there was to the Universe. Despite a suggestion first made by William Herschel in the 18th century, he shared the accepted view that all nebulae were relatively nearby objects and merely patches of dust and gas in the sky.</p>\r\n<h2>The turning point</h2>\r\n<p>Hubble had to spend many bitterly cold nights sitting at the powerful Hooker telescope before he could prove Shapley wrong. In October 1923 he spotted what he first thought was a nova star flaring up dramatically in the M31 &quot;nebula&quot; in the constellation of Andromeda. After careful examination of photographic plates of the same area taken previously by other astronomers, including Shapley, he realised that it was a Cepheid star. Hubble used Shapley's method to measure the distance to the new Cepheid. He could then place M31 a million light-years away - far outside the Milky Way and thus itself a galaxy containing millions of stars. The known Universe had expanded dramatically that day and - in a sense - the Cosmos itself had been discovered!</p>\r\n<p>Even The New York Times of the day realised the importance of the discovery: <em>&quot;Finds spiral nebulae are stellar systems. Doctor Hubbel [sic] confirms view that they are 'island universes' similar to our own.&quot;</em></p>\r\n<h2>Just the beginning</h2>\r\n<p>This discovery was of great importance to the astronomical world, but Hubble's greatest moment was yet to come. He began to classify all the known nebulae and to measure their velocities from the spectra of their emitted light. In 1929 he made another startling find - all galaxies seemed to be receding from us with velocities that increased in proportion to their distance from us - a relationship now known as Hubble's Law.</p>\r\n<p>This discovery was a tremendous breakthrough for the astronomy of that time as it overturned the conventional view of a static Universe and showed that the Universe itself was expanding. More than a decade earlier, Einstein himself had bowed to the observational wisdom of the day and corrected his equations, which had originally predicted an expanding Universe. Now Hubble had demonstrated that Einstein was right in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>The now elderly, world-famous physicist went specially to visit Hubble at Mount Wilson to express his gratitude. He called the original change of his beloved equations <em>&quot;the greatest blunder of my life.&quot;</em></p>\r\n<h2>Another war stops Hubble again</h2>\r\n<p>Hubble worked on indefatigably at Mount Wilson until the summer of 1942, when he left to serve in World War II. He was awarded the Medal of Merit in 1946. Finally, he went back to his Observatory. His last great contribution to astronomy was a central role in the design and construction of the Hale 200-inch Telescope on Palomar Mountain. Four times as powerful as the Hooker, the Hale would be the largest telescope on Earth for decades. In 1949, he was honoured by being allowed the first use of the telescope.</p>\r\n<h2>No Nobel Prize for an astronomer</h2>\r\n<p>During his life, Hubble had tried to obtain the Nobel Prize, even hiring a publicity agent to promote his cause in the late 1940s, but all the effort was in vain as there was no category for astronomy. Hubble died in 1953 while preparing for several nights of observations, his last great ambition unfulfilled.</p>\r\n<p>He would have been thrilled had he known that the Space Telescope is named after him, so that astronomers can continue to<em> &quot;hope to find something we had not expected&quot;</em>, as he said in 1948 during a BBC broadcast in London. </p>\r\n",

It is measured in two different ways: \r\n                In number of proposals and in time (here measured in units of \r\n                Hubble orbits, i.e. 96 minutes).</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"/static/science/img/esafraction.jpg\" width=\"582\" height=\"404\" /></p>\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><p class=\"style1\"><strong>Duccio Macchetto<br />\n</strong> Head of the ESA's Space Telescopes Division</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"7%\"><span class=\"style1\"></span></td>\n<td width=\"86%\"><span class=\"style1\"><em>&quot;ESA has 15 European scientists working at \r\n                        <a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu\">STScI</a> in Baltimore as part \r\n                    of its contribution to the science operations of Hubble. This \r\n                    European contingent has not only played a significant part \r\n                    in the successful operation of the Hubble Observatory, but \r\n                    has also often consisted of young European astronomers taking \r\n                    the opportunity to work in a highly stimulating environment. \r\n                    Many European Hubble Observers have spent periods of research \r\n                    time at STScI and several European students have completed \r\n                    their Ph.D. studies there.

The number of papers based on Hubble observations published \r\n                each year has been increasing continuously since the telescope&rsquo;s \r\n                launch. There is at least one European author or co-author on \r\n                about 30% of these papers, indicating the importance of Hubble \r\n                to European astronomy.</p>\n",

Part of this is to establish some success metrics and \n                to evaluate the product after completion. But it is undeniably \n                very difficult to quantify successful science communication. What \n                defines a success? Is it the &#8216;importance&#8217; of the medium? \n                The number of readers? The type of readers? Web hits/ downloaded \n                Gigabytes? Most often it is a complex mix of all these factors.</p>\n              <p><strong>Qualitative evaluation</strong></p>\n              <p>A rigorous statistical investigation of the impact is appropriate \n                to determine the success of a given product, but due to the limited \n                resources available for communication <em>an intuitive/subjective \n                understanding</em> of the market response can also play an important \n                role. This impact estimate can only be made if a very close contact \n                to the target groups is maintained. A sporadic monitoring of the \n                impact in selected media, ideally spanning a few years, will enable \n                an intuitive understanding of which products and approaches or \n                angles are most effective.

During its lifetime Hubble has become one of the most important science projects ever.</strong></p>\r\n<h2>Mission Objectives</h2>\r\n<p>Hubble's orbit above the Earth's distorting atmosphere allows astronomers to make the very high resolution observations that are essential to open new windows onto planets, stars and galaxies. Hubble was designed as a high standard flagship mission and has paved the way for other space-based observatories. Notably it can access the otherwise invisible ultraviolet part of the spectrum, and also has access to areas of the infrared not visible from the ground..</p>\r\n<h2>Mission Name</h2>\r\n<p>\t\tThe Hubble Space Telescope is named after Edwin Powell Hubble (1889-1953) who was one of the great pioneers of modern astronomy.</p>\r\n<h2>Spacecraft</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Design: </strong>At the heart of Hubble are a 2.4 m primary mirror and a collection of five science instruments that work across the entire optical spectrum &mdash; from infrared, through the visible, to ultraviolet light. Hubble is equipped with cameras, spectrographs and fine guidance sensors. The observatory was designed to be serviced in space, allowing outdated instruments to be replaced. The telescope was placed into a low-Earth orbit by the Space Shuttle and uses modular components so that it can be recovered on subsequent Shuttle Servicing missions and faulty or outdated parts more easily replaced before being re-released into orbit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Power:</strong> Power for the computers and scientific instruments onboard is provided by two 2.6 x 7.1 m solar panels. The power generated by the panels is also used to charge six nickel-hydrogen batteries that provide power to the spacecraft for about 25 minutes per orbit while Hubble flies through the Earth&rsquo;s shadow.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Manoeuvring:</strong> The telescope uses an elaborate system of attitude controls to improve its stability during observations. A system of reaction wheels manoeuvres the telescope into place and its position in space is monitored by gyroscopes. Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) are used to lock onto guide stars to ensure the extremely high pointing accuracy needed to make very accurate observations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Length: 13.2 m, diameter: 4.2 m. In addition two solar panels each 2.6 x 7.1 m.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mass:</strong> 11 110 kg (at the time of launch).</p>\r\n<h2>Instruments</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>The Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) </li>\r\n  <li>The Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) </li>\r\n  <li>The Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) </li>\r\n  <li>The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) </li>\r\n  <li>The Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) </li>\r\n  <li>Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Orbit</h2>\r\n<p>Hubble was deployed by the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-31) into a circular orbit 569 km above the ground, inclined at 28.5 degrees to the Equator. The telescope whirls around Earth at 28,000 kilometres an hour and takes 96 minutes to complete one orbit. As of autumn 2009, the telescope has made more than 100,000 trips around our planet. Those trips correspond to more than 4 billion kilometres, which is the equivalent of a round trip to Saturn.</p>\r\n<h2>Observations &amp; Data</h2>\r\n<p>As of autumn 2009, the Hubble Space Telescope has made nearly 900,000 observations and snapped over 570,000 images of more than 29,000 celestial objects. The 19 years&rsquo; worth of observations has produced nearly 39 terabytes of data and, each month, the orbiting observatory generates more than 80 gigabytes of data. The ST-ECF Hubble archive sends more than half a terabyte of data each month to astronomers throughout the world.</p>\r\n<p>Astronomers using Hubble data have published more than 7,500 scientific papers, making it one of the most productive scientific instruments ever built. In 2008 scientists published nearly 700 journal articles on Hubble telescope data.</p>\r\n<h2>Operations Centre</h2>\r\n<p>\t\tThe science operations are co-ordinated and conducted by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore and at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt.</p>\r\n",

It is the remnant of one of Nature&rsquo;s most violent processes &ndash; a supernova explosion. In 1054 Chinese astronomers observed a new and very bright star that continued to be visible for the next 2 years. A supernova is produced at the end of the life of a massive star when the nuclear processes in the interior of the star can no longer persist. The star collapses, triggering an extreme explosion releasing, at its peak, more energy than an entire galaxy. Shockwaves from supernova explosions can trigger the formation of new stars and solar systems such as our own.</p>\n<p> The incredibly filamentary structure seen throughout the entire image consists of remnant material from interior of the original star &ndash; a violent testimony of the explosion that ripped the star apart.</p>\n<p> The Crab Nebula provides one of Nature&rsquo;s finest laboratories, where studies of the effects of a supernova explosion can be undertaken. These explosions are crucial for our understanding of how the composition of matter in the Universe evolves.</p>\n<p> At the core of a star is the nuclear furnace where lighter elements are combined to produce heavier elements accompanied by the release of energy. This process of nucleosynthesis generates all the heavier atoms that make up &lsquo;normal&rsquo; matter in the Universe, including the atoms that build the carbon-based life we find on Earth. The very heaviest elements need conditions even more extreme than the cores of &lsquo;normal&rsquo; stars - conditions that prevail in the very explosion of a massive star, and are thus another by-product of supernovas. Supernova remnants like the Crab Nebula, impelled out into the surrounding interstellar medium, will eventually disperse the processed elements that may then become part of new stars. There is no star yet observed that contains only the original hydrogen and helium components of the Universe that were produced in the first three minutes after the Big Bang.</p>\n<p> At the heart of the Crab Nebula lies a dense object known as a neutron star or pulsar. This is an extremely compact object with a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun and a diameter of only 10 km. Neutron stars are fascinating objects that display some of the most extreme high energy physics we are able to observe in Nature. The Crab pulsar is only barely visible in this Hubble image, since the image was taken to highlight the gas in the filaments. The pulsar has a very strong magnetic field and is spinning very fast - approximately 30 times every second. From the magnetic poles it emits a beam of synchrotron radiation - much like the sweeping beam of a lighthouse - and the characteristic pulsed signal is best observed with X-ray telescopes such as the European Space Agency&rsquo;s XMM-Newton or NASA&rsquo;s Chandra X-ray Observatory. It is in fact the energy from the slowing down of the pulsar that keeps the entire Crab nebula shining. </p>\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n",

Q: Given the latest advances in Hubble instrumentation, image processing etc. what would the absolute theoretical limit for the smallest object visible on the Moon be?</strong><br />\r\n                <br />\r\n                <strong>A:</strong> Since this question really asks for the &quot;full treatment&quot;, let's look at it in detail.<br />\r\nThe so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution\">Rayleigh criterion</a> gives the maximum (diffraction limited) resolution, R, and is approximated for a telescope as <br />\r\nR = Lambda/Diameter, <br />\r\nwhere R is the resolution [Radians] and Lambda is the wavelength [m]or with &quot;normal&quot; units as<br />\r\n\r\n                R = 0.21 * L/D <br />\r\n                in the units [arc-seconds or &quot;] = [microns]/[meter]<br />\r\n                <br />\r\n                So for Hubble this is:<br />\r\n                R = 0.21 * 0.500/2.4 = 0.043&quot; (for optical wavelengths, 500 nm)<br />\r\n                or<br />\r\n                R = 0.21 * 0.3/2.4 = 0.026&quot; (for Ultraviolet light, 300 nm)<br />\r\n                <br />\r\n                The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device\">CCD detectors</a> in Hubble's instruments should, in theory, have been adapted to this number and follow the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist-Shannon_sampling_theorem\">Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem </a>i.e. have 2 pixels per resolution element (i.e. 0.0125&quot; pixels), but for good scientific reasons, like getting a larger Field of View, this is not the case. The pixels in the different instruments are typically 0.05&quot;/pixel and the best sampling is 0.025&quot;/pixel for the <a href=\"/about/general/instruments/acs/\">ACS</a>/HRC instrument.<br />\r\n                <br />\r\n                With so-called dithering and drizzling one can \r\nimprove sampling and\r\nminimise resolution loss of undersampled images by shifting the telescope back and forth between exposures with a fraction of a pixel. <br />\r\n                <br />\r\nWhen these methods are applied, the final effective resolution of\r\ntelescope and detector can at best be \r\ncalculated as: <br />\r\nR= sqrt (telescope optical resolution^2 +&nbsp; pixel size^2) <br />\r\ni.e. for Hubble with ACS/HRC, and in the UV (300nm):<br />\r\n                R= sqrt (0.026^2 + 0.025^2) = 0.036&quot;<br />\r\n                <br />\r\n                Then, in an extreme case, such as the Moon where there are lots of light (a high <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio\">Signal/Noise</a> ratio), one can do image processing (image restoration) and retrieve roughly a factor of 2 better resolution at the expense of some artifacts, i.e. for Hubble 0.018&quot; (best best case in Ultraviolet).<br />\r\n                <br />\r\n                On the Moon, we can transfer this to the following linear extension with the help of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_angle_approximation\">Small-angle approximation</a>:<br />\r\n                linear extension = distance * R/206264 in units [m] = [m] * [&quot;]/[1/&quot;]<br />\r\n                <br />\r\n                On the Moon, with its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon\">minimum distance</a>, this would give a linear extension of:<br />\r\n              363,000,000 * R /206264&nbsp; =  32 metres</p>\r\n              <p><em>So 32 metres should be the minimum size of an object visible as more than a dot.</em></p>\r\n              <p><strong>15. Q: Does ESA have any robotic proposal that could \r\n                  be useful for servicing Hubble and other space equipment? </strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A:</strong> No, and none is planned. </p>\r\n              <p><strong>14. Q: Do you think it was a good idea that NASA decided \r\n                not to carry out Servicing Mission 4?</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A: </strong>The Columbia Accident Investigation Report \r\n                stipulates that a &quot;safe haven&quot; is required for the crew \r\n                of the Space Shuttle in case the Shuttle cannot return to the \r\n                ground. The International Space Station provides this capability; \r\n                Hubble does not. Rescue could only be performed by launching a \r\n                second Shuttle within a few days. This is very difficult from an operational stand-point.</p>\r\n              <p>Whether it was a good or a bad idea is irrelevant. It was \r\n                the only option available in ageement with the guidelines of the \r\n                Columbia Accident Report and within the available budget. For \r\n                the science of astronomy it is a setback, especially since there \r\n                will not be a replacement for Hubble any time soon.</p>\r\n              <p>Currently there are attempts to 'stretch' Hubble's life as far \r\n                as possible, and we will only know how successful these attempts \r\n                are when Hubble fails one day. Whether that will be 5 years earlier \r\n                than expected (2010) or only one or two remains to be seen.</p>\r\n              <p><strong>13. Q: Wouldn't a robotic mission to service Hubble be \r\n                even more expensive than sending astronauts?</strong></p>\r\n              <p> <strong>A:</strong> No. Depending on what one includes in the \r\n                calculation (actual costs, or including the fraction of initial \r\n                investment, etc.) a single Space Shuttle launch costs up to 1000 \r\n                million US Dollars. Even developing a robotic mission from scratch \r\n                would cost less than that. In addition, some limited robotic capability \r\n                is required in any case in order to bring  Hubble down in a \r\n                controlled manner: Several of the heavy elements of the telescope, \r\n                like the main mirror, will survive re-entry, and they might cause \r\n                damage on the ground. So it is important to de-orbit the telescope \r\n                in such a way that it lands in the Pacific Ocean (or lift it into \r\n                a much higher orbit). </p>\r\n              <p><strong>12. Q: Do you think Hubble is still necessary?</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A:</strong> Hubble currently provides the best resolution \r\n                in the optical and Ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range. This is \r\n                extremely important for the identification of interesting objects. Adaptive \r\n                optics techniques can be used with ground-based telescopes to \r\n                obtain a similar resolution to that of Hubble, but only for small \r\n                fields-of-view and in the infrared wavelength range. Also adaptive \r\n                optics currently is limited to certain areas of the sky where \r\n                the necessary 'guide stars' are available.</p>\r\n              <p>As mentioned, Hubble provides access to the ultraviolet wavelength \r\n                range. The UV light is blocked by the Earth's atmosphere, \r\n                so observations in the UV can only be performed from space. They \r\n                are very important in order to understand the physical processes \r\n                that take place in astronomical objects.</p>\r\n              <p><strong>11. Q: I heard that Hubble had problems in its first \r\n                years. What really happened?</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A: </strong>Yes, it is true. During its first three years Hubble suffered from what \r\n                is known as spherical aberration. \r\n                Spherical aberration is an optical defect and simply put, although Hubble's main mirror had a perfect shape, it was two microns too flat. \r\n                The problem was caused by a faulty measuring device used during \r\n                the polishing.<br />\r\n                During the First Servicing Mission the problem was solved by \r\n                installing an extra optical device in Hubble called COSTAR.<br />\r\n                The spherical aberration in Hubble's main mirror is still there, \r\n                but today it does not affect the observations - partly due to \r\n                COSTAR and partly due to built-in optical corrections in the newer \r\n                instruments.<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p><strong>10. Q: How much has the Hubble Telescope cost overall \r\n                so far?</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A:</strong> As you may know, Hubble is a collaboration \r\n                between ESA and NASA. ESA has 15% of the observing time, and Europe's \r\n                financial contribution to Hubble is 593 million Euros as of 1999 \r\n                terms (including the development of FOC and the Solar Arrays, \r\n                the participation in the operations and in the relevant Servicing \r\n                Missions). The US expenditure is currently an estimated 4.5 to \r\n                6 billion US$.<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p><strong>9. Q: What do you think is Hubble's best photo so far?</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A: </strong>Oh - that is almost a naughty question ;-) \r\n                Hubble has produced so many fantastic pictures. And to tell you \r\n                the truth: I change my taste once in a while. These days it is \r\n                the Keyhole Nebula which is my favourite.<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p><strong>8. Q: Why is Hubble able to see so much better than telescopes \r\n                on earth?</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A:</strong> Because it is above the Earth's atmosphere. \r\n                The atmosphere disturbs the starlight (a bit like looking through \r\n                water) and blurs the images. So Hubble's images are much sharper \r\n                than those from other telescopes.<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p><strong>7. Q: What has the Hubble Space Telescope found out about \r\n                the beginning of the universe?</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A:</strong> It is a bit difficult to state in just a \r\n                few sentences. Hubble has measured the age and size of the Universe \r\n                better than before (by refining value for the Hubble constant \r\n                - or the expansion rate). It has also seen details in the first \r\n                galaxies that are not visible from the ground. Today we know that \r\n                galaxies were formed earlier than previously thought and most \r\n                scientists also believe that they evolve by colliding and merging \r\n                together.<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p><strong>6. Q: What are the Hubble deep space fields?</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A:</strong> These are two very long (&gt; 100 hours) exposures \r\n                showing details of the remote Universe never seen before. I can \r\n                recommend reading the new 10 year brochure that is also available \r\n                on the web (under &quot;Further information&quot;).<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p><strong>5. Q: What is going to be so much better about the NGST?</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A: </strong>The Next Generation Space Telescope will be \r\n                much larger than Hubble - it will be able to collect ten times \r\n                more light and thus see much fainter objects. A special \r\n                feature is that it will mainly be sensitive to Infrared (heat-) \r\n                radiation. This means that it can look further out into the Universe \r\n                than with any other telescope and see the first galaxies as they \r\n                form. Check also the pages on NGST.<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p><strong>4. Q: As the Big Bang could be similar to a conventional \r\n                blast, and therefore the Universe developed around it, how is \r\n                possible to state that there is not a center of the universe? \r\n                And then how is possible to take a picture of the most ancient \r\n                radiation and see it as it were around the photographers (Hubble \r\n                and then us)?</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A:</strong> The similarity of the expansion of the Universe \r\n                to a conventional blast is a typical misconception in the popularizations \r\n                of the cosmological model, possibly due to the unfortunate choice \r\n                of the name 'Big Bang'. As a matter of fact the expansion of the \r\n                Universe is totally different from a conventional blast, which \r\n                happens 'within' a given space. The expansion of the Universe \r\n                'is' the expansion of the space-time itself, together with its \r\n                energy-matter content. Admittedly it is not easy to imagine the \r\n                correct scenario, because it is so different from our experience \r\n                of everyday life. An additional difficulty related to \r\n                your second question is that this is due to the fact that the velocity of \r\n                light, although very high, is still finite (~ 300.000 km/sec). \r\n                Therefore, if we look at objects which are at some distance from \r\n                us, we see them as they were sometime ago, the elapsed time being \r\n                exactly the time needed by the light to reach us. For example, \r\n                the image of the surface of the Sun that we can observe is always \r\n                8 minutes old, because it takes about 8 minutes for the sunlight \r\n                to reach the Earth. If you look at the stars of the Orion constellation, \r\n                which are roughly at a distance of 900-1000 light years, you see \r\n                them as they were 900-1000 years ago. If some of them would have \r\n                exploded today as a supernova, you (or your future relatives!) \r\n                would know about this event only in a millennium. </p>\r\n              <p>This explains (we hope) why we can see pictures of the very old \r\n                Universe: we just have to have powerful enough telescopes to look \r\n                very far away. We see 'Universe' around us up the limit that cosmologists \r\n                call the 'horizon'. As time passes by, we get a larger picture of the Universe, \r\n                as the horizon gets bigger and bigger. This scenario must be true \r\n                for any 'observer' in the Universe, and he or she will think to \r\n                be at the 'centre' of the expansion. In this sense, there is no \r\n                centre. Your questions are very profound because they go back \r\n                to the very nature of space-time and of the cosmological models. \r\n                It is not easy to answer properly in a few sentences. We would suggest \r\n                you take the time to read some serious scientific book on Cosmology \r\n                and meditate on the difference between the 'world' that we model \r\n                around us on the basis of our daily experience and the one that \r\n                describes the entire Universe. The difference in scale matters \r\n                a lot!<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p><strong>3. Q: I was wondering a few things. First how far can \r\n                the Hubble Space Telescope actually see?</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A:</strong> Actually the telescope itself has no limits \r\n                - but the Universe itself does. Hubble is a medium-sized (2.4 \r\n                meter) telescope with very sharp optics and very good instruments. \r\n                This enables the telescope to see very faint objects despite its \r\n                relatively modest size. According to the theory of Big Bang, the \r\n                absolute observational limit to telescopes (as we know them today) \r\n                is a 'sphere' of opaqueness surrounding us positioned approximately \r\n                13-14 billion light years away. It is called the 'surface of last \r\n                scattering', and is also known as the source of the 'microwave background \r\n                radiation'. Up to 300.000 years after Big Bang, the Universe was \r\n                totally opaque to light. This means that we know that we (when \r\n                we look out in the Universe and thus back in time) will never \r\n                see past, or through, this barrier.</p>\r\n              <p>Today galaxies that have been seen with Hubble are at a distance \r\n                of approximately 12-13 billion light years. In the coming years \r\n                more distant galaxies will undoubtedly be detected, but the limit \r\n                for our observations will not progress a lot for two reasons. Firstly, \r\n                the galaxies have to have time to form stars after Big Bang (this \r\n                takes roughly one billion years). Secondly, the young galaxies \r\n                will be enshrouded in large amounts of dust that will - at least \r\n                to some degree - obscure our view of the early Universe.</p>\r\n              <p><strong>2. Q: In the Hubble FAQ you mention that the telescope \r\n                will never be aimed at the Earth. What about the Moon? Would it \r\n                still be damaging for Hubble's instruments? If feasible, could \r\n                these observations take a picture of the landing site of the Apollo \r\n                missions?</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A: </strong>Indeed there has been a few cases where Hubble \r\n                has been aimed at the Moon - see <a href=\"/images/?search=9914\">here</a>. It has to be done with greatest \r\n                care (since the Moon is very bright and can damage instruments \r\n                etc.), and is normally avoided. Even with Hubble's incredible \r\n                sharpness (resolution) only objects the size of a football field \r\n                can be seen (~100 metres)... so no Apollo spacecrafts will likely be \r\n                visible. With novel image processing techniques this may be improved in the future, but we will have to wait and see. </p>\r\n              <p><strong>1. Q: What if the hubble telescope  watched the Earth, \r\n                what resolutions would the images possible have? I would guess \r\n                approx. 10 - 20 cm?!?</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A:</strong> Hubble's so-called angular resolution - or \r\n                sharpness - is measured as the smallest angle on the sky that \r\n                it can be 'resolved' (i.e. see sharply). This is 1/10 of an arc-second \r\n                (one degree is 3600 arc-seconds). If Hubble looked at the Earth - \r\n                from its orbit of approx. 600 km - this would in theory correspond \r\n                to 0.3 meter or 30 cm (almost the same as you found). Quite impressive! \r\n                But the 'blurring' of the atmosphere downwards would make the \r\n                actual resolution worse. Unfortunately, Hubble will never be turned \r\n                to Earth since a) the brightness of the Earth could be damaging \r\n                for the telescope and the instruments, and b) there is not any \r\n                particularly interesting astronomical research to be done there \r\n                (the type of science that deals with the Earth is called geophysics).</p>\r\n              <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n              ",

It's based on \r\n                the older NIH Image program from the 90's and is free: <a href=\"http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/\">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</a> \r\n                .

To our knowledge it does not \r\n                exist for Photoshop, although it would be an obvious place to \r\n                have it here. The tool we use is <a href=\"http://www.aurigaimaging.com/\">Registar</a>. \r\n                We are investigating whether it is feasible to develop a registration \r\n                tool for Photoshop.

Q: The Photoshop action script does not download as \r\n                expected on a Mac.</strong> \r\n              <p><strong>A</strong>: You have to &quot;save linked file as&quot;, \r\n                i.e. Alt-click on the file. \r\n              <p><strong>2: Q: I seem to have problems installing the plug-in \r\n                with a non-English Photoshop.</strong> \r\n              <p><strong>A:</strong> Indeed.

Consider \r\n                combining classes in the two subjects for a couple of weeks and \r\n                discussing the making of astronomical images both from the purely \r\n                aesthetic viewpoint and also from a rigid scientific point of \r\n                view. Computer classes will appreciate seeing direct applications \r\n                of techniques in a visual field like astronomy. \r\n              <p> Students might employ the same work strategy as a professional \r\n                outreach group: first by acquiring the raw astronomical data directly \r\n                from astronomers (the datasets), and then by creating an aesthetically \r\n                pleasing image and a news release, perhaps for publication in \r\n                the school magazine or on the school intranet.\r\n              <p> A professional outreach group will normally read the original \r\n                scientific papers and then interview the scientists concerned \r\n                to find the story that will catch the scientific journalist&#8217;s \r\n                eye. Students could use an original news release as background \r\n                material and then write an article that is accessible to students \r\n                in other disciplines. The article should of course be illustrated \r\n                by an image that they have produced themselves. Alternatively \r\n                the class could divide into several different groups, each group \r\n                producing an article for a single collected issue.\r\n              <p> Note: The raw image files are in 16-bit format, and are therefore \r\n                quite large. Depending on the internet connection at your school, \r\n                it might be wise to download the images beforehand.\r\n              <p> Some more detailed questions are given below, for students to \r\n                consider as they work on the images. Feel absolutely free to edit \r\n                the questions as you see fit (pun intended :-)).

The BAPS can position the telescope at a variety of angles and rotate it a full 360 degrees to bring any part of HST within the reach of the astronauts and the RMS, or robot arm. </p>\r\n<p><strong>BPS BAPS Support Post </strong>&ndash; This post is installed to keep the BAPS immobile during activities which generate high torques on the HST, for example reboost. </p>\r\n<p><strong>C-5</strong> A heavy logistics global transport aircraft that provides a massive strategic airlift and express delivery of padded or oversized cargo as well as passengers. It has transported HST flight hardware and personnel to and from GSFC and KSC. </p>\r\n<p><strong>COS </strong>Cosmic Origins Spectrograph - Fourth Generation Spectrometer. COS is an ultraviolet spectrograph optimised for observing faint point sources with moderate spectral resolution </p>\r\n<p><strong>COSTAR </strong>Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial - Second Generation Corrective Optics. COSTAR is not an actual instrument, but a system of mirrors that refocus the light and correct for the aberration from HST's optical system for first generation instruments. The FOC is the only instrument remaining today that uses COSTAR. </p>\r\n<p><strong>DF-224</strong> Onboard Digital Fixed Point 2's complement 24-bit word Rockwell computer module. This is the main computer which controls the attitude (orientation) of the Hubble Space Telescope. </p>\r\n<p><strong>ESA</strong> European Space Agency </p>\r\n<p><strong>EVA</strong> Extravehicular activity; outside the spacecraft; activity in space conducted by suited astronauts. This is also known as a spacewalk. </p>\r\n<p><strong>FGS</strong> Fine Guidance Sensor - Science/Guidance instruments. The FGS's are used in a &quot;dual-purpose&quot; mode serving to lock on to &quot;guide stars&quot; which help the telescope achieve the exceedingly accurate pointing necessary for observation of astronomical targets. These instruments can also be used to obtain highly accurate measurements of stellar positions. </p>\r\n<p><strong>FOC</strong> Faint Object Camera - First Generation Imaging camera. FOC is used to image very small fields of view, very faint targets. Last first generation instrument on HST </p>\r\n<p><strong>FOS</strong> Faint Object Spectrograph - - First Generation Spectrometer. FOS was used to obtain spectra of very faint or far away sources. FOS also had a polarimeter for the study of polarised light from these sources </p>\r\n<p><strong>FSS</strong> Flight Support System (Structure) &ndash; This is the name for the structure which holds HST and provides power and computer interfaces while it is berthed to an Orbiter during Servicing. </p>\r\n<p><strong>GHRS</strong> Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph - First Generation Spectrograph. GHRS was used to obtain high resolution spectra of bright targets </p>\r\n<p><strong>GSFC</strong> Goddard Space Flight Center &ndash; Greenbelt, Maryland. The HST Project is run from here. </p>\r\n<p><strong>HOST mission </strong>Hubble Space Telescope Orbital Systems Test (1998) &ndash; This mission tested several pieces of equipment in preparation for SM3A and SM3B. </p>\r\n<p><strong>HST</strong> Hubble Space Telescope </p>\r\n<p><strong>KSC</strong> Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, FL &ndash; KSC is responsible for launches. </p>\r\n<p><strong>MLI</strong> Multi-layer insulation. This is the highly reflective material which is attached to spacecraft to act as a thermal barrier. It consists of many sheets of 25 &micro;m thick polyester or polyamide layers sewn together. It is often silver or gold in colour. </p>\r\n<p><strong>NASA</strong> National Aeronautics and Space Administration </p>\r\n<p><strong>NCS</strong> NICMOS Cooling System&ndash; This mechanical cooler was tested during the HOST mission and will be installed during SM3B to allow NICMOS to resume science operations. </p>\r\n<p><strong>NICMOS</strong> Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer - Second Generation Imager/Spectrograph. NICMOS is HST's only NIR instrument. </p>\r\n<p><strong>NIR</strong> Near Infrared &ndash; Near Infrared light is not visible to human eyes, but many celestial objects shine brightly with this light. Typically associated with heat, NIR images show the presence of molecules and complex compounds. </p>\r\n<p><strong>NOBL</strong> New Outer Blanket Layer &ndash; The NOBL are stainless steel panels covered with a protective thermal coating. These panels fit over existing, degraded insulation on Hubble's exterior surface to control Hubble's internal temperature. In 1997, astronauts on Servicing Mission 2 discovered damaged areas of insulation and performed temporary repairs. The NOBL will be permanently mounted </p>\r\n<p><strong>OCE-EK</strong> Optical Control Electronics Enhancement Kit </p>\r\n<p><strong>ORU/ORI</strong> Orbital Replacement Unit / Orbital Replacement Instrument Since HST was designed to be serviced in orbit, many of the systems, and all of the instruments were designed and built as replaceable units. </p>\r\n<p><strong>ORUC</strong> Orbital Replacement Unit Carrier &ndash; Special boxes which isolate the delicate instruments and other ORUs from the forces and vibrations present during launch and the ascent into orbit. </p>\r\n<p><strong>RSU</strong> Rate Sensor Unit - The gyroscopes are part of Hubble's pointing system. They provide a frame of reference for Hubble to determine where it is pointing and how that pointing changes as the telescope moves across the sky. They report any small movements of the spacecraft to Hubble's pointing and control system computers. The computers then command the spinning reaction wheels to keep the spacecraft stable or moving at a desired rate. The gyroscopes work by comparing Hubble's motion relative to the axis of the spinning masses inside the gyroscopes. In the absence of external forces, these axes remain stable relative to the fixed stars in the sky. By keeping Hubble fixed relative to these axes, Hubble stays stable relative to the stars </p>\r\n<p><strong>SM1</strong> First HST Servicing Mission, December 1993 </p>\r\n<p><strong>SM2</strong> Second HST Servicing Mission, February 1997 </p>\r\n<p><strong>SM3A</strong> HST Servicing Mission 3A, December 1999 </p>\r\n<p><strong>SM3B</strong> HST Servicing Mission 3B, planned for 2001 </p>\r\n<p><strong>SSAT</strong> S-band Single-Access Transmitter - This replacement transmitter uses radio waves to send data to the ground.

Gyroscopes are important because they measure the rate of motion as Hubble moves and help ensure the telescope retains correct pointing during observations. </em></p>\n<h2>How Gyroscopes Work</h2>\n<p>Gyroscopes maintain orientation and provide stability in boats, aircraft and spacecraft based on the principles of angular momentum.  You can experience this effect by holding a bicycle wheel by its axle and asking someone to spin the wheel. If you try to move the axle of the spinning wheel, you will feel a force opposing your attempt to move it. This force is similar to the one produced in the gyroscopes when Hubble moves.</p>\n<p>Each gyroscope contains a wheel spinning at 19,200 revolutions per minute inside a sealed cylinder. This cylinder is immersed in a thick, motor-oil-like fluid. Fine, hair-like wires, surrounded by this thick fluid, carry electricity to the motor. Oxygen-pressurized air, used to force the thick fluid into the float cavity that contains these wires, has corroded the wires and caused them to break. Pressurized nitrogen, used in the new gyroscopes, will eliminate the introduction of corrosive oxygen.</p>\n<h2>The Best Gyroscopes in the World</h2>\n<p>Several different types of gyroscopes are available: mechanical using ball bearings; other designs using light or the frequency of a resonating hemisphere to detect movement; and gas bearings.  Of these only gas-bearing gyroscopes offer the combination of extremely low noise with very high stability and resolution. Gas-bearing gyroscopes are the most accurate in the world and Hubble uses the best available. </p>\n<p>Hubble&rsquo;s gyroscopes are extraordinarily stable and can detect even extremely small movements. When used with other fine-pointing devices, they keep the telescope precisely pointed for long periods, enabling Hubble to produce its spectacular views of the Universe.</p>\n<h2>Rate Sensor Units</h2><p>Each Rate Sensor Unit (RSU) contains two gyroscopes.  When astronauts replace failed gyroscopes they always replace a single RSU.  In 1993 on the first servicing mission, astronauts changed two units.  In 1999, they changed all three units.  In SM4 astronauts will, once again, upgrade all 3 of the RSU.</p>\n<h2>How many are needed?</h2>\n<p>At any given time, Hubble needs three of its six gyroscopes operating to ensure optimal efficiency. In August 2005, Hubble began operating in a new two-gyro mode to extend the telescope&rsquo;s life and ensure it had at least two functioning gyroscopes until Servicing Mission 4. Although the telescope can operate on only two gyroscopes, the regions of the sky that on view are limited.</p>\n<p><strong>Links</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/206045main_GYROS_FS-2006-11-087_12_4.pdf\"><b>Fact Sheet</b></a> (PDF file)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>\n",

            "content": "<h1>History: How Hubble Came About</h1>\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe Earth's atmosphere is the bane of astronomers. The idea of sending a telescope into space to avoid it was first proposed long before the first satellites were launched, long before anyone even dreamt of sending astronauts to space, German rocket scientist Herman Oberth was a pioneering thinker of his time and suggested a space bound telescope as early as 1923 in his book &quot;Die Rakete zu den Planetr&auml;umen&quot;. A space telescope avoids frustrating problems such as cloudy and misty observing nights, the twinkling of stars even on clear nights and absorption of the ultraviolet and infrared parts of the spectrum. </p>\r\n<p>It took many years before technology caught up with Oberth's idea. The American Lyman Spitzer proposed a more realistic plan for a space telescope in 1946 and lobbied for his idea for almost 30 years. In the 1970s NASA and the European Space Agency took up the idea and proposed a 3 metre space telescope. Funding began to flow in 1977 and it was decided to name the telescope after Edwin Powell Hubble who had discovered the expansion of the Universe in the 1920s. Although the Hubble Space Telescope was down-sized to 2.4 metres the project started to attract significant attention from astronomers.</p>\r\n<p>The precision-ground mirror was finished in 1981 and the assembly of the entire spacecraft was completed in 1985. The plan called for a launch on NASA's Space Shuttle in 1986, but just months before the scheduled launch the Challenger disaster caused a year long delay of the entire Shuttle programme. Hubble was finally launched in 1990 and the tension built up as astronomers examined the first images through Hubble's eyes.</p>\r\n<p>As in all good adventures, success does not come easily: it did not take more than two months to realise that Hubble's mirror had a serious flaw. A focusing defect prevented Hubble from taking sharp images - the mirror edge was too flat by a mere fiftieth of the width of a human hair. Over the next months scientists and engineers from NASA and ESA worked together and came up with a superb corrective optics package that would restore Hubble's eyesight completely.</p>\r\n<p>A crew of astronauts carried out the repairs necessary to restore the telescope to its intended level of performance during the first Hubble Servicing Mission (SM1) in December 1993. Although the two subsequent servicing missions were at least as demanding in terms of complexity and work load, SM1 captured the attention of both astronomers and the public at large to a degree that no other Shuttle mission since has achieved. Meticulously planned and brilliantly executed, the mission succeeded on all counts. It will go down in history as one of the highlights of human spaceflight. Hubble was back in business.</p>\r\n<p>Since SM1 three other Servicing Missions have been carried out: during SM2 in 1997 two new instruments were installed, in SM3A, 1999, many of Hubble's crucial technical systems were exchanged, and in 2002 came SM3B when Hubble again got new science instruments.</p>\r\n<p>Servicing Mission 4 is scheduled to upgrade Hubble's scientific capabilities again. The unavoidable 'end-of-mission' is scheduled for the year 2013 and will pull down the curtain on Hubble's run of unprecedented scientific discoveries. </p>\r\n",

However, immediately after launch people were reminded that Hubble was not just an ordinary satellite, but a complex piece of innovative engineering and, as such, liable to teething problems.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The most serious and notorious of these was an optical defect called spherical aberration, which was caused by the malfunction of a measuring device used during the polishing of the mirror. As a result, Hubble could not achieve the best possible image quality, although still outperforming ground-based telescopes in many ways. Analysing the problem and developing an optical correction was a masterpiece of optical engineering and an outstanding example of the valuable collaboration between engineers and scientists from both America and Europe.</p>\r\n<p>During the first Hubble Servicing Mission in December 1993, a crew of astronauts carried out the repairs necessary to restore the telescope to its intended level of performance. Although the two other servicing missions which have since been performed were at least as demanding in terms of complexity and workload, the First Servicing Mission captured the attention of both the professional community and the public at large to a degree that no other Shuttle mission has achieved. Meticulously planned and brilliantly executed, the mission succeeded on all counts. It will go down in history as one of the highlights of human spaceflight.</p>\r\n<p>The Wide Field and Planetary Camera 1 was replaced with a second-generation camera (Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2) and the High-Speed Photometer was replaced with COSTAR (Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement). COSTAR is not a science instrument but a corrective optics package that corrects the aberration for the three remaining scientific instruments: the Faint Object Camera (FOC), the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS), and the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS).</p>\r\n",

Over the 13-day mission,  astronauts repaired two instruments, replaced two others and also performed  other necessary maintenance work on the veteran observatory. </p>\r\n              <p>The high quality of this image will make  for a dramatic display and a fitting tribute to Hubble&rsquo;s twenty years in orbit.  ESA has therefore decided to produce 100 laminated copies of the image, which  can be rolled and shipped across Europe. </p>\r\n              <p>We invite all European-based science  centres, museums, planetariums, nature centres and other informal education  venues to apply to receive one of these images. </p>\r\n              <p>In order to submit this application, the  applicant (on behalf of associated institution) must agree to the following  terms of the Hubble 20th anniversary image unveiling:</p>\r\n              <ul type=\"disc\">\r\n                <li>Hold an image       unveiling event in celebration of Hubble&rsquo;s 20th anniversary in orbit. </li>\r\n                <li>Identify a       long-term plan for displaying the Hubble anniversary image (e.g. a       permanent exhibit gallery).</li>\r\n                <li>Honour the       ESA/NASA press embargo. Images may not be displayed prior to the ESA/NASA       press release.

Hubble has provided the visual overview of the underlying \r\n                astrophysical processes taking place in these objects, ranging \r\n                from planets in our Solar System to galaxies in the young Universe.</p>\r\n              <p>Astronomy is fortunate in that telescopes not only produce results \r\n                of great scientific value, but also of eye-catching beauty and \r\n                artistic potential. This book shows the close relationship between \r\n                the two at its best.</p>\r\n              <p>The book is 120 pages. 30 x 25 cm (coffee-table), full-colour, \r\n                printed on high-quality glossy paper.

The launch window will\r\n\tbe open between 02:21 and 3:03 CET. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Saturday Dec. 18, 02:35 CET\r\n\tNASA </h2>\r\n<p>Test Director Steve Altemus has announced that the\r\n\t\tcountdown will not start again at the planned 02:38 CET. The\r\n\t\tT-minus 9 minutes hold will be extended in the hope that the weather\r\n\t\tsituation will improve. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Saturday Dec. 18, 01:58 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>T-minus 9 and holding. A planned 40 minute hold is being performed.\r\n\t\tthe time will among other things be used to monitor the weather to\r\n\t\tdetermine if the launch will be aimed at the first part of the launch\r\n\t\twindow. \r\n\t\tThe weather does not seem promising at the moment. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Saturday Dec. 18, 01:47 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>T-minus 20 and counting. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Saturday Dec. 18, 01:38 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>T-minus 20 and holding. A planned 10-minute hold is being\r\n\t\tperformed. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Saturday Dec. 18, 01:33 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The launch window has just been extended with four minutes. The\r\n\t\twindow now stretches to as late as 03:33:32 CET. A launch between \r\n\t\t03:29:22 and 03:33:32 CET would mean that Discovery will \r\n\t\trendezvous with Hubble on Flight Day 4 as opposed to the originally\r\n\t\tplanned Flight Day 3. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Saturday Dec. 18, 01:27 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The countdown clock is ticking toward T-minus 20 minutes where a \r\n\t\t10-minute hold is planned. A final built-in hold is scheduled at \r\n\t\tT-minus 9 minutes and will last for 40 minutes. </p>\r\n<p>The main concern continues to be weather conditions in the local \r\n\tKSC area. The forecast is calling for thick low clouds and rain. It is \r\n\tcurrently raining at KSC and U.S. Air Force weather officials are \r\n\tnot too hopeful for launching Discovery before the end of the \r\n\t42-minute window. \r\n\t(Source: Spaceflight Now) </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Saturday Dec. 18, 00:45 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The crew compartment hatch is being closed. </p>\r\n<p>Update for Saturday Dec. 18, 00:10 CET \r\n\tThe astronauts are now all aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery. \r\n\tForecasters say that the heaviest rain passed over Kennedy Space\r\n\tCenter around 23:30. \r\n&quot;No technical issues are being addressed at this moment&quot; is the\r\n\tmessage from NASA. But the weather remains critical. If the launch\r\n\twill be postpone, it has been confirmed that NASA will try again\r\n\ttomorrow. The launch window will in this case open approximately 23\r\n\t1/2 hours after tonight's scheduled launch. </p>\r\n<p>God Speed to you all from ESA Science! </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Friday Dec. 17, 23:28 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The seven astronauts have reached the launch pad are now preparing\r\n\t\tto enter the Shuttle. It is still the hope that the frontal system will move to the north before the launch in a little more than three hours. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Friday Dec. 17, 23:14 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The team of astronauts have now departed from their quarters and are\r\n\t\ton their way to the tower. \r\n\t\tThe weather is still reason for concern. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Friday Dec. 17, 23:05 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The team inspecting the orbiter did not find any problems and the\r\n\t\tcountdown clock is no longer on hold - T minus 2 hours 59 minutes. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Friday Dec. 17, 22:49 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>Countdown is to resume in 15 minutes. The crew has just had a\r\n\t\tweather briefing, and are now putting on their flight suits. \r\n\t\tThere is a weak frontal system over Florida, but there is some\r\n\t\toptimism that this front will move to the north. NASA officials\r\n\t\tanticipate that the weather situation will improve somewhat before\r\n\t\tlaunch. \r\n\t\tThe launch window is 42 minutes and will open at 02:47 CET. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Friday Dec. 17, 22:10 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>Discovery on Kennedy Space Center launch pad 39B is being\r\n\t\tchecked for signs of ice build-up on the outside of the external tanks.\r\n\t\tDue to the wet weather there is risk for condensation and following\r\n\t\tice build-up on the tanks. So far there has not been found any signs of\r\n\t\tice. Indeed very little frost seems visible on the tanks. \r\n\t\tIn the moment the tanks are continuously being topped off with more\r\n\t\tfuel as some of the very cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen boils away. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Friday Dec. 17, 21:51 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>Approximately 1 hour 15 minutes left of the planned hold. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Friday Dec. 17, 21:00 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The external tank has been filled with liquid hydrogen and oxygen.\r\n\t\tThe countdown has entered a two-hour planned hold at T-3 hours. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Friday Dec. 17, 20:00 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>No problems was found concerning the welding paperwork. \r\n\t\tThe countdown is now ticking although weather conditions do not\r\n\t\tlook favourable. NASA estimates that there is only a mere 20%\r\n\t\tchance for a launch tonight due to thick cloud layers and possibility of\r\n\t\tcoastal showers. \r\n\t\tPreparations for the launch are nevertheless continuing: Discovery's\r\n\t\texternal tank is now almost filled with more than 1,5 million liters of\r\n\t\tfuel - liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. </p>\r\n<p>The schedule for the astronauts looks like this (from Florida Today - times in CET):</p>\r\n<p> 17:00 - The crew wakes up to begin their day \r\n\t23:02 - Astronauts depart for launch pad 39B \r\n\t00:47 - Discovery's main hatch is closed for flight \r\n\t02:47 - Launch</p>\r\n",

There is still time in the schedule to make tonight's\r\n\t\tlaunch, but the fuelling must begin by 19:00 according to the plan. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Saturday Dec. 18, 17:40 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>NASA managers have now decided that they - in case of another\r\n\t\tpostponement - will attempt a launch on Monday morning with a\r\n\t\tlaunch window between 01:50 and 02:32 CET. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Saturday Dec. 18, 17:09 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The weather forecast for tonight's launch at 02:21 CET does\r\n\t\tunfortunately not look very promising. There is a 70% risk for\r\n\t\tviolations of some of the many weather criteria set by NASA for this\r\n\t\tninth attempt to launch the Shuttle on Hubble Servicing Mission 3A.\r\n\t\tAgain a low cloud cover and rain are the looming factors. \r\n\t\tOne piece of good news is that NASA officials now are investigating\r\n\t\twhether the post-landing work may be shortened by one day. This\r\n\t\twould make a launch attempt Monday morning possible.

Everything went according to\r\n\t\tplans. Nicollier and Clervoy powered up the robotic arm. Afterwards\r\n\t\tClervoy moved a camera on the robotic arm and did, together with\r\n\t\tthe two spacewalk teams Nicollier/Foale, and Smith/Grunsfeld, a\r\n\t\tthorough check-out of the equipment in the Shuttle cargo bay - the\r\n\t\tsocalled berthing table on which Hubble is going to sit during the\r\n\t\tspacewalks, and the components they are going to replace. \r\n\t\tAfter lunch the pilots Mission Commander Brown and Pilot Kelly set\r\n\t\tup tools for the rendezvous with Hubble while Nicollier, Foale and\r\n\t\tGrunsfeld unpacked and checked the spacesuits. </p>\r\n<p>In a brief interview Mission Specialist Foale explained that he\r\n\tpersonally was convinced that the they would be able to replace the\r\n\tsix gyros, install the voltage/temperature kits, change the computer,\r\n\tthe Fine Guidance Sensor, the S-band transmitter and the recorder\r\n\tduring the three planned spacewalks. </p>\r\n<p>The astronauts will wake up at 16:20 CET. The capture of Hubble is\r\n\texpected to take place at 01:40 CET tonight, Dec. 22. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Monday Dec. 20, 19:25 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The seven astronauts woke up at 16:50 CET. They are still in the &quot;post sleep&quot; phase. This basically means waking up, eating breakfast\r\n\t\tjust like any other person. And then naturally also reviewing today's\r\n\t\tplan carefully which has been updated to reflect the actual launch time.\r\n\t\tMission planners have had a hard time following all the changes in the\r\n\t\tschedules as the launch has been postponed time after another. But\r\n\t\teverything is now in place. </p>\r\n<p>In a few minutes - around 19:30 CET - the team will begin their duties\r\n\tof the day. The day will mainly be concerned with unpacking tools,\r\n\tchecking equipment and spacesuits. Around 7:00 CET tomorrow\r\n\tmorning there will be a half hour engine burn manoeuvre to get\r\n\tDiscovery in a better orbit for the grappling of Hubble. Other than that\r\n\tthe most important issues of the day will be getting everything ready\r\n\tfor tomorrow's grappling operation. </p>\r\n",

It is very nice to see the telescope up close after three years. No changes are visible, but it will naturally be interesting to see if this also holds when the team gets a closer look.</em></p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 08:50 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The astronauts went to sleep an hour ago after a hard working day.\r\n\t\tEverything went according to schedule. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 03:47 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The rest of this working day in space will be spent unpacking and\r\n\t\tdonning equipment for tomorrow's spacewalk. At 7:50 CET the crew\r\n\t\twill go to sleep for 8 hours. </p>\r\n<p>In a brief comment to the ground the astronauts expressed their\r\n\tsatisfaction with the accomplishment of todays tasks, and they\r\n\tthanked the ground crew and everyone participating in the work\r\n\tbehind the scene. They also mentioned the beauty of the sight of\r\n\tHubble getting closer and closer during the rendezvous. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 03:15 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>Hubble is now being scrutinized with the cameras on the robotic arm.\r\n\t\tThis will continue for an hour or so. The pictures will serve as basis\r\n\t\tfor the whole Hubble project to assess any changes with the telescope\r\n\t\tor its instruments. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 03:07 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>Hubble has been connected with the power line from Discovery and\r\n\t\tare now being fed power directly from here. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 02:33 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>Hubble has been latched safely in the cargo bay. Now work can\r\n\t\tbegin for real. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 02:15 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>Discovery has just entered daylight and the first marvellous pictures\r\n\t\tfrom one of Discovery's cameras reveal a shiny healthy looking\r\n\t\tHubble! </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 01:51 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>When Hubble has been latched in the correct position in the cargo\r\n\t\tbay one of the first tasks the team will perform is to check the\r\n\t\ttelescope with cameras on the robotic arm. \r\n\t\tA curious thing was that the grappling operation happened exactly\r\n\t\tover Houston where Johnson Space Center, which is controlling this\r\n\t\tpart of the mission, is located. And many people did get a unique sight\r\n\t\tof Discovery and Hubble together. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 01:40 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>Clervoy is rotating Hubble with the robotic arm to set it down\r\n\t\tcorrectly in the berthing fixtures in the Shuttle bay. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 01:34 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>Capture has been confirmed! Congratulations! &quot;Hubble grappled&quot; as\r\n\t\tClervoy phrases it. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 01:20 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>40 meters before Hubble is within Clervoy's reach. \r\n\t\tThe speed is now 0.2 km/hour. \r\n\t\tThe Space Telescope Operations Control Center (STOCC) has\r\n\t\tfinished their work with the preparations of Hubble for the\r\n\t\trendezvous. \r\n\t\tEverything is ready! Good luck to Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Clervoy.</p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 01:05 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>200 meters. Hubble is rotating very very slowly. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 01:01 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>300 meters left. The speed is down to 1.5 km/hour. Discovery is\r\n\t\tpositioned directly below Hubble - this means that the astronauts at\r\n\t\tthe moment should be looking up at the opening of telescope (which\r\n\t\tpoints down towards Earth). </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 00:55 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>600 meters left. Discovery is approaching Hubble with approximately\r\n\t\t3 km/hour. Mission Commander Brown is now taking over manual\r\n\t\tcontrol of the Shuttle to perform the final sensitive manoeuvres. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Tuesday Dec. 21, 23:50 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>We have just now received information about the position of Hubble\r\n\t\tin space. The telescope is pointing somewhat upside-down with\r\n\t\trespect to the &quot;normal&quot; servicing mission position. That is\r\n\t\tapproximately 180 degrees from this position. Instead of the back end\r\n\t\t- the socalled aft shroud - pointing downwards to Earth, it is actually\r\n\t\tthe tip of the telescope which is pointing downwards. Mission\r\n\t\tCommander Brown has trained extensively for this particular case,\r\n\t\tand it now seems clear that he will have to move the Shuttle around\r\n\t\tHubble. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Tuesday Dec. 21, 23:32 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The TI burn was successfully carried out. Within the next two hours\r\n\t\twe should be able to see Hubble through the eyes of the cameras\r\n\t\tonboard Discovery. The distance is 15 kilometres. \r\n\t\tThe rendezvous is still planned for 01:41 CET although the time for\r\n\t\tthe capture of Hubble itself will depend somewhat of its actual\r\n\t\torientation. Since Hubble is in safe mode using only backup gyros its\r\n\t\texact orientation in space is not known. \r\n\t\tCommander Brown may have to move Discovery around Hubble in\r\n\t\torder for Clervoy to be able to grab the telescope with the robotic\r\n\t\tarm. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Tuesday Dec. 21, 22:28 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>Next upcoming event will be the final approach manoeuvres - the\r\n\t\tsocalled Terminal Initiation (TI) burn - which will bring Discovery on\r\n\t\tright course for the rendezvous. The TI will occur at 23:28 CET. \r\n\t\tThe distance to Hubble is now approximately 40 km and the relative\r\n\t\tspeed of Discovery is 37 km/h. The crew has already some time ago\r\n\t\treported to have visual contact with Hubble. </p>\r\n<p>The Space Telescope Operations Control Center (STOCC) at\r\n\tGoddard Space Flight Center, Washington DC, reports that all\r\n\tsystems on Hubble are behaving nicely, and that their preparations\r\n\twith the various systems and instruments onboard are going according\r\n\tto the schedule. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Tuesday Dec. 21, 19:32 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The engine burn has been performed, and everything went smoothly.\r\n\t\tDiscovery's orbit is now slightly higher, and the speed of the\r\n\t\tspacecraft has been reduced. \r\n\t\tThis manoeuvre was performed while Discovery was momentarily &quot;out of sight&quot; from both of the two TDRSS (Tracking and Data Relay\r\n\t\tSatellite System) satellites relaying the radio communication from the\r\n\t\tShuttle to the ground. This happens for a few minutes in every orbit\r\n\t\tover the Indian Ocean. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Tuesday Dec. 21, 18:40 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>In about 50 minutes (19:28) the first of a series of engine burns will \r\n\t\tput Discovery on a direct course for the rendezvous. The next engine\r\n\t\tburn will happen 45 minutes later. \r\n\t\tDiscovery has received a &quot;go&quot; for the grappling of Hubble. Still 7\r\n\t\thours to go... </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Tuesday Dec. 21, 18:00 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The distance between the Shuttle and Hubble is now 350 km and the\r\n\t\tShuttle is getting closer with about 240 km every orbit lasting 90\r\n\t\tminutes. \r\n\t\tEverything is working according to plans and the rendezvous with\r\n\t\tHubble is expected to happen 01:41 CET. \r\n\t\tWell, in fact there is a minor &quot;problem&quot;: A paper jam in a printer used\r\n\t\tto print mission plans and messages from the ground. </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/static/about/img/discoveryapproach1sm.jpg\" alt=\"The Shuttle and Hubble are now (16:35 CET) at a distance of approximately 600 km.

The next spacewalk\r\n\t\tis scheduled for 20:40 CET later this evening. \r\n\t\tThe plan for this second spacewalk on this mission is: </p>\r\n<p>0:00-0:15 Set-up. \r\n\t0:15-2:05 Replacement of the computer. \r\n\t2:15-5:15 Replacement of Fine Guidance Sensor 2. \r\n\t5:15-6:00 Close-out. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Thursday Dec. 23, 04:15 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The spacewalk ended officially at 04:10 CET which means that the\r\n\t\ttotal duration was 8 hours and 15 minutes. Only one earlier\r\n\t\tspacewalk, during STS-49, lasted longer - 8 hours 29 minutes. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Thursday Dec. 23, 03:45 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The astronauts are now entering the airlock after one of the longest\r\n\t\tspacewalks in history. \r\n\t\tThe aliveness test for the VIKs turned out positive. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Thursday Dec. 23, 03:30 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The crew have now almost finished cleaning the Shuttle bay for tools\r\n\t\tand equipment. In 20-25 minutes the spacewalk should end. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Thursday Dec. 23, 03:05 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The last remaining three VIKs have now been installed. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Thursday Dec. 23, 02:35 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>Grunsfeld has installed three of the voltage/temperature kits (VIKs),\r\n\t\tand as a little bonus, Smith has at the same time installed some of the\r\n\t\thandrailing covers. \r\n\t\tIt has now been decided to install the last three VIKs anyway. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Thursday Dec. 23, 01:55 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>Smith and Grunsfeld had some problems closing the aft shroud doors.\r\n\t\tThese doors are rather large and a somewhat wobbly. It took a little\r\n\t\tbit of effort and some time. In fact the team on the First Servicing\r\n\t\tMission also had problems closing these doors, but at least this time it\r\n\t\twent much easier. \r\n\t\tDue to the time constraints it has been suggested that the team will\r\n\t\tonly change three of the six voltage/temperature kits tonight. The rest\r\n\t\twill have to be done tomorrow. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Thursday Dec. 23, 01:15 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The NICMOS tasks are now completed. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Thursday Dec. 23, 00:38 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The crew will now move back to the NICMOS valves and try to\r\n\t\tforce them open. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Thursday Dec. 23, 00:22 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>It has been confirmed that the third gyro-pair is working. This means\r\n\t\tthat we can say that Hubble has now been repaired! The rest of the\r\n\t\tmission will mainly be concerned with improvements of Hubble's\r\n\t\tcapabilities. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Thursday Dec. 23, 00:15 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The NICMOS task did not succeed, but they have photographed the\r\n\t\tvalves and may return later. Now the team presses on with installation\r\n\t\tof the temperature/voltage kits which are going to prevent overheating\r\n\t\tof the batteries onboard. \r\n\t\tSmith and Grunsfeld have been spacewalking for 4 hours and 20\r\n\t\tminutes now. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Thursday Dec. 23, 00:00 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The next task is to remove caps on coolant valves on the NICMOS\r\n\t\t(Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer) instrument.\r\n\t\tThis is necessary in order to get rid of any left-over nitrogen coolant\r\n\t\tas a preparation for the installation of a new NICMOS cooler on the\r\n\t\tnext Servicing Mission (SM3B scheduled for 2001). This operation\r\n\t\tshould only take about 15 minutes.. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 23:45 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The last set of two gyros have now been replaced! The aliveness test\r\n\t\tis still to be performed. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 23:15 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The work is progressing well. STOCC confirmed that the first new set\r\n\t\tof gyros work. The second set has been installed and are also\r\n\t\tworking perfect. </p>\r\n<h2>Update for Wednesday Dec. 22, 22:35 CET\t</h2>\r\n<p>The first two gyros have been replaced.

The night's spacewalk was another one for the record books, 8 hours and 10 minutes, making it the third longest spacewalk in history. The longest was the third spacewalk during STS-49 in 1992 which lasted 8 hours and 29 minutes. The second longest was yesterday's spacewalk which lasted 8 hours and 15 minutes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Astronauts Nicollier from ESA and Foale from NASA carried out the tasks - the exchange of Hubble's computer and a Fine Guidance Sensor - without any serious problems. The work with the computer began at 20:54 CET, and was finished 22:20 CET. The fine guidance sensor was in place 02:11 CET (Dec. 24), after some minutes of tension where Nicollier and Foale worked intensively on sliding the sensor on place. </p>\r\n<p>Following the exchange the computer and the fine guidance sensor were &quot;aliveness&quot; tested. Both were found to be correctly installed. More testing will be carried out while the astronauts sleep - between 07:50 - 15:50 CET (on Dec. 24). </p>\r\n<p>The new computer is a 486 model and it will be 20 times faster and have six times as much memory as the previous model - a socalled DF-224 designed in the 70's. The reason for not sending up the latest computer equipment to space is a demand for a flawless operation in the very harsh environment in space. The lifetime of the 486 is expected to exceed the 10 years Hubble itself is expected to be in operation. Despite being bombarded by cosmic and solar radiation constantly and being exposed to extreme temperatures. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>There are three fine guidance sensors on Hubble. Two are all the time being used to point Hubble at the objects being observed. The third can then be used to make a special type of observations known as astrometry. Astrometry deals with the determination of precise positions and motions of stars.\r\n\tThe next spacewalk will be this mission's third and last.

The tasks on this spacewalk included finishing the\r\n\tinstallation of the fine guidance sensor, which was installed during the\r\n\tsecond spacewalk, together with replacement of a faulty radio\r\n\ttransmitter and a data tape recorder. Additionally installation of\r\n\tthermal insulation was on today's to do-list for the astronauts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Within the first hour of leaving the air hatch astronauts Grunsfeld and\r\n\tSmith had installed an optical control electronics package for the fine\r\n\tguidance sensor. They immediately moved on to the rather difficult\r\n\ttask of replacing the S-band radio transmitter. This unit failed in 1998,\r\n\tbut the other transmitter has so far been able to handle the\r\n\tcommunication tasks alone. The unit was never meant to be changed in\r\n\tspace and John Grunsfeld required all his concentration to remove\r\n\tsmall bolts and connectors wearing the big gloves of his spacesuit.</p>\r\n<p>Amazingly the work went smoothly and the team pressed on with the\r\n\tinstallation of a new solid-state data recorder that replaced the old\r\n\treel-to-reel tape recorder. Again there were no problems and initial\r\n\ttests of both the transmitter and recorder showed no problems. The\r\n\tnew recorder not only uses better technology (solid state memory\r\n\tchips) for storing the observation data, but it will also be able to store\r\n\t10 times more data (1.5 Gbyte). The ability to simultaneously record\r\n\tand play back data, in addition to having access all data at once makes\r\n\tthis recorder a big improvement taking Hubble into the new millenium.</p>\r\n<p>The last work to be done was the replacement of thermal insulation on\r\n\tHubble's outside. Time constraints meant that the work had to stop\r\n\tafter installation of insulation on two of the equipment bays, but still the accomplishments of this servicing mission are truly outstanding!</p>\r\n<p>It now seems that Hubble will not only be able to work again after\r\n\tmore than two months of downtime, but will be able to work much\r\n\tmore efficiently than before. Final tests will be carried out before\r\n\tHubble's release Sunday 26 December at 00:03 CET.</p>\r\n",

The connection between the shuttle and Hubble will  take place in an orbit 589 km above the Earth.  Due to Hubble&rsquo;s orbit around the Earth, it will not be possible for the crew to  refuge in the International Space Station if the shuttle was, for instance,  damaged at launch. </p>\r\n\t\t  <p>The mission will  feature five spacewalks during the flight, which will be performed by two  different teams of spacewalkers on alternative days.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p>The mission was originally  planned to upgrade the telescope by installing two new scientific instruments:  the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) replacing a no-longer used instrument  called COSTAR, and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3 replacing the current WFC2.  Each has advanced technology sensors that will dramatically improve Hubble&rsquo;s  potential for discovery and enable it to observe the faint light from the  youngest stars and galaxies in the Universe. </p>\r\n\t\t  <p>However, the failure  of Hubble&rsquo;s main camera - the Advanced Camera for Surveys - on 27 January 2007 has  made this mission even more invaluable to the future of Hubble. ACS&rsquo;s failure  by an electrical glitch has curtailed the flow of high-resolution imagery from  Hubble until 2008. The installation of the WFC3 and the repair of Hubble&rsquo;s  spectrographic instrument will replace and increase the lost power of the ACS. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t  <p>The crew will also try  to repair Hubble&rsquo;s broken Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). Such a  complex task, considered to be the most challenging repair job since the  replacement of a power control unit in 2002, will entail the removal of 111  non-captive screws and the replacement of a power supply circuit board. </p>\r\n\t\t  <p>Additionally, Hubble  will witness the installation of a cooling system to lower the spectrometer&rsquo;s  temperature and the repair of its thermal insulation. Moreover, the astronauts  will install a fixture enabling the attachment of a small rocket module to drop  the observatory safely out of orbit when it ceases to be operational.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p>Other upgrades will  include the installation of several pallets in the shuttle&rsquo;s cargo bay:</p>\r\n\t\t  <ul>\r\n\t\t    <li>The Super  Lightweight Interchangeable Carrier (SLIC) will contain the new Wide Field  Camera 3 and two battery modules for Hubble.</li>\r\n\t\t    <li> The Orbital  Replacement Unit Carrier (ORUC) will be home to the new Cosmic Origins  Spectrograph, the three Rate Sensor Units, its 6 new gyroscopes and the renewed  Fine Guidance Sensor.</li>\r\n\t\t    <li> The Flight Support  System (FSS) is the platform that will keep Hubble secured during its five days  of servicing.</li>\r\n\t\t    <li> The Multi-use  Logistic Equipment Carrier (MULE) will house several components and additional  parts for Hubble. MULE will also contain extra cans of lithium hydroxide (LiOH)  that would help rinse out carbon dioxide from the shuttle&rsquo;s cabin atmosphere in  case the mission were to be extended in time.</li>\r\n\t\t  </ul>\r\n\t\t  <p>Service mission 4 will  also see the arrival of a completely new camera at Hubble. An IMAX 3D camera  will fly aboard the Space Shuttle recording Hubble&rsquo;s servicing mission for an  IMAX 3D space film.&nbsp; <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n\t\t    Before setting Hubble  free, the astronauts will verify the functioning of the new devices and  upgraded instruments and reorient the telescope. Moreover, the crew will use  the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) to examine the improved shuttle&rsquo;s thermal  heat shield. Once fully repaired and upgraded, Hubble will be released and then  watch the space shuttle slowly move away from it. </p>\r\n\t\t  <p>With such an  astounding increase in its science capabilities, Hubble will continue to  penetrate the most distant corners of space and reveal further breathtaking  phenomena.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t  <h2>Links</h2>\r\n\t\t\t<ul><li>\r\n\t\t\t  <p><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/hst_sm4/index.html\">Meet the astronauts</a></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t  </li>\r\n\t\t\t    <li>\r\n\t\t\t        <p> <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/hst_sm4/overview.html\">NASA&rsquo;s description of SM4</a></p>\r\n\t\t\t    </li>\r\n\t\t\t    </ul>\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t<td width=\"38%\" valign=\"top\"><p><img src=\"/static/archives/images/news/heic0618a.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>New Servicing Mission to upgrade instruments .</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"/static/about/img/instrumentcomparisonsm.gif\"><img src=\"/static/about/img/sm4graph.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"135\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>Here is shown the relative \"discovery efficiencies\" of the current Hubble cameras and the WFC3.

There are back-up channels for each instrument, but technicians need time to assess the status of Hubble and schedule additional repairs.</p>\n<p>The fifth and final Hubble servicing mission, Shuttle mission STS-125, was originally planned as an 11-day assignment to replace two instruments, hopefully fix two more and replace gyros, batteries and other components crucial for the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope&rsquo;s continued success through to the year 2014.</p>\n<p>This mission, named Servicing Mission 4, or  SM4, since SM3 was split in two missions, almost failed to materialise. In the  wake of the Columbia Space Shuttle tragedy in 2003, NASA officials decided that  astronauts had to be able to reach a safe haven in case any damage caused to a shuttle  made a return to Earth too risky. Hubble&rsquo;s orbit around the Earth makes  it impossible for the seven-member crew to take refuge in the International  Space Station if the Shuttle is, for instance, damaged during launch. After a  re-examination of risks, on 31 October 2006, NASA Administrator Michael Griffin  decided, however, that Hubble was such an invaluable tool to astronomers and  the public alike that undertaking a last servicing mission was acceptable. A  second Shuttle will be ready for launch during the SM4 mission in order to  minimize risks to the astronauts. </p>\n<p>On launch, Atlantis will enter an orbit inclined at 28.5&deg; to the Earth&rsquo;s equator  on a path that will intercept Hubble approximately three days after launch. Following  capture, the mission requires five spacewalks, performed by two teams of  astronauts operating on alternate days, to carry out all the necessary work.</p>\n<h2>New Instruments: WFC3 &amp;  COS</h2>\n<p>The  initial plans for the mission consisted of upgrades to Hubble by installing two  new scientific instruments: the <a href=\"/about/general/instruments/cos/\">Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS)</a>, replacing  the obsolete <a href=\"/about/general/instruments/costar/\">COSTAR</a> package; and the <a href=\"/about/general/instruments/wfc3/\">Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)</a>, replacing the  current <a href=\"/about/general/instruments/wfpc2/\">WFPC2</a>. Both instruments feature  advanced technology that will dramatically improve Hubble&rsquo;s potential for  discovery and enable observation of faint light from the youngest stars and  galaxies in the Universe.</p>\n<p>COS  will primarily study changes in light emitted from faint and distant quasars that  has passed through intergalactic gas clouds.&nbsp;The changes will reveal details on the nature of the gas, its evolution,  and influence on surrounding galaxies.</p>\n<p>WFC3  allows Hubble to capture large-scale, detailed images from the near infrared to  the far ultraviolet.</p>\n<h2>Fixing Current Instruments: STIS &amp; ACS</h2>\n<p>\r\n\t\t    Replacing instruments  is complicated enough, but there is an additional twist with the need to fix  two failed instruments: the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Space  Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS).&nbsp;The attempt to repair both these instruments is unprecedented as neither is designed to be fixed, or even maintained in space, and so engineers  have developed new tools and procedures especially for this mission.

The connection between the shuttle and Hubble will  take place in an orbit 589 km above the Earth.  Due to Hubble&rsquo;s orbit around the Earth, it will not be possible for the crew to  refuge in the International Space Station if the shuttle was, for instance,  damaged at launch. </p>\r\n\t\t  <p>The mission will  feature five spacewalks during the flight, which will be performed by two  different teams of spacewalkers on alternative days.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p>The mission was originally  planned to upgrade the telescope by installing two new scientific instruments:  the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) replacing a no-longer used instrument  called COSTAR, and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3 replacing the current WFC2.  Each has advanced technology sensors that will dramatically improve Hubble&rsquo;s  potential for discovery and enable it to observe the faint light from the  youngest stars and galaxies in the Universe. </p>\r\n\t\t  <p>However, the failure  of Hubble&rsquo;s main camera - the Advanced Camera for Surveys - on 27 January 2007 has  made this mission even more invaluable to the future of Hubble. ACS&rsquo;s failure  by an electrical glitch has curtailed the flow of high-resolution imagery from  Hubble until 2008. The installation of the WFC3 and the repair of Hubble&rsquo;s  spectrographic instrument will replace and increase the lost power of the ACS. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t  <p>The crew will also try  to repair Hubble&rsquo;s broken Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). Such a  complex task, considered to be the most challenging repair job since the  replacement of a power control unit in 2002, will entail the removal of 111  non-captive screws and the replacement of a power supply circuit board. </p>\r\n\t\t  <p>Additionally, Hubble  will witness the installation of a cooling system to lower the spectrometer&rsquo;s  temperature and the repair of its thermal insulation. Moreover, the astronauts  will install a fixture enabling the attachment of a small rocket module to drop  the observatory safely out of orbit when it ceases to be operational.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p>Other upgrades will  include the installation of several pallets in the shuttle&rsquo;s cargo bay:</p>\r\n\t\t  <ul>\r\n\t\t    <li>The Super  Lightweight Interchangeable Carrier (SLIC) will contain the new Wide Field  Camera 3 and two battery modules for Hubble.</li>\r\n\t\t    <li> The Orbital  Replacement Unit Carrier (ORUC) will be home to the new Cosmic Origins  Spectrograph, the three Rate Sensor Units, its 6 new gyroscopes and the renewed  Fine Guidance Sensor.</li>\r\n\t\t    <li> The Flight Support  System (FSS) is the platform that will keep Hubble secured during its five days  of servicing.</li>\r\n\t\t    <li> The Multi-use  Logistic Equipment Carrier (MULE) will house several components and additional  parts for Hubble. MULE will also contain extra cans of lithium hydroxide (LiOH)  that would help rinse out carbon dioxide from the shuttle&rsquo;s cabin atmosphere in  case the mission were to be extended in time.</li>\r\n\t\t  </ul>\r\n\t\t  <p>Service mission 4 will  also see the arrival of a completely new camera at Hubble. An IMAX 3D camera  will fly aboard the Space Shuttle recording Hubble&rsquo;s servicing mission for an  IMAX 3D space film.&nbsp; <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n\t\t    Before setting Hubble  free, the astronauts will verify the functioning of the new devices and  upgraded instruments and reorient the telescope. Moreover, the crew will use  the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) to examine the improved shuttle&rsquo;s thermal  heat shield. Once fully repaired and upgraded, Hubble will be released and then  watch the space shuttle slowly move away from it. </p>\r\n\t\t  With such an  astounding increase in its science capabilities, Hubble will continue to  penetrate the most distant corners of space and reveal further breathtaking  phenomena.\r\n\t\t  <br />\r\n\t\t  <br />\r\n\t\t  <br />\r\n\t\t  <h2>\tTasks\tof SM4   <br />\r\n\t\t    <br />\r\n\t\t    </h2>\r\n\t\t  <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"1\" width=\"100%\">\r\n\r\n                      <tbody>\r\n                        <tr bgcolor=\"#f1f1f8\">\r\n                          <td bgcolor=\"#cccccc\" valign=\"top\" width=\"27%\"><b>Install WFC3 -

Two are used to point and lock the telescope on the target, and the third can be used for position measurements - also known as astrometry. Because the FGS'es are so accurate, they can be used to measure stellar distances and also to investigate binary star systems. The three FGS'es are located at 90-degree intervals around the circumference of the telescope. Since Hubble needs very high pointing accuracy the FGS'es have been constructed as so-called interferometers that take advantage of the wavelike features of the in-coming starlight. So they can search for a wobble in the motion of nearby stars that could indicate the presence of a planetary companion, determine if certain stars really are double stars, measure the angular diameter of stars, galaxies, etc.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<table border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"2\">\r\n            \t<tr>\r\n            \t\t<td colspan=\"2\"><h2>FGS Facts</h2></td>\r\n            \t\t</tr>\r\n            \t<tr>\r\n            \t\t<td width=\"141\"><strong>Instrument type</strong></td>\r\n            \t\t<td width=\"179\">Astrometric interferometers</td>\r\n            \t\t</tr>\r\n            \t<tr>\r\n            \t\t<td><strong>Weight</strong></td>\r\n            \t\t<td>220 kg</td>\r\n            \t\t</tr>\r\n            \t<tr>\r\n            \t\t<td><strong>Dimensions</strong></td>\r\n            \t\t<td>0.5x1x1.6 m</td>\r\n            \t\t</tr>\r\n            \t<tr>\r\n            \t\t<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Field of view</strong></td>\r\n            \t\t<td>69 arcminutes (only 5x5 arcseconds at any one time)</td>\r\n            \t\t</tr>\r\n            \t<tr>\r\n            \t\t<td><strong>Wavelength range</strong></td>\r\n            \t\t<td>467 to 700 nm</td>\r\n            \t\t</tr>\r\n            \t<tr>\r\n            \t\t<td><strong>Resolution</strong></td>\r\n            \t\t<td>0.002 arcseconds</td>\r\n            \t\t</tr>\r\n            \t</table>\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p></td>\r\n\t\t<td width=\"38%\" valign=\"top\"><p><img src=\"/static/about/img/fgs_sm.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"288\" alt=\" One of the three Fine Guidance Sensors fotographed during Second Servicing Mission in 1997.\" /></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>One of the three Fine Guidance Sensors photographed during Second Servicing Mission in 1997.</em></p></td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n",

It combines a camera with a spectrograph, and covers a wide range of wavelengths from the near-infrared region into the ultraviolet. A spectrograph spreads out the light gathered by a telescope so that it can be analyzed to determine such properties of celestial objects as chemical composition and abundances, temperature, radial velocity, rotational velocity, and magnetic fields. Its spectrograph can be switched between two different modes of usage: 1.So-called &quot;long slit spectroscopy&quot; where spectra of many different points across an object are obtained simultaneously. 2.So-called &quot;echelle spectroscopy&quot; where the spectrum of one object is spread over the detector giving better wavelength resolution in a single exposure. STIS also has a so-called coronograph which can block light from bright objects, and in this way enables investigations of nearby fainter objects.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t\t<table width=\"316\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"2\">\r\n            \t<tr>\r\n            \t\t<td colspan=\"2\"><h2>STIS Facts</h2></td>\r\n            \t\t</tr>\r\n            \t<tr>\r\n            \t\t<td><strong>Instrument type</strong></td>\r\n            \t\t<td>Camera and Spectrograph</td>\r\n            \t\t</tr>\r\n            \t<tr>\r\n            \t\t<td><strong>Weight</strong></td>\r\n            \t\t<td>318 kg</td>\r\n            \t\t</tr>\r\n            \t<tr>\r\n            \t\t<td><strong>Dimensions</strong></td>\r\n            \t\t<td>2.2 x 0.9 x 0.9 m</td>\r\n            \t\t</tr>\r\n            \t<tr>\r\n            \t\t<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Field of view</strong></td>\r\n            \t\t<td>MAMA - 25 x 25 arcseconds <br />\r\n            \t\t\tCCD - 50 x 50 arcseconds</td>\r\n            \t\t</tr>\r\n            \t<tr>\r\n            \t\t<td><strong>Wavelength range</strong></td>\r\n            \t\t<td>115 to 1000 nm</td>\r\n            \t\t</tr>\r\n            \t</table>\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t<td width=\"38%\" valign=\"top\"><p><img src=\"/static/about/img/slide12high.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"159\" alt=\" The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS).\" /></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em><br />\r\n\t\t\t\tThe Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS).</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"/static/about/img/2329_-2.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"145\" alt=\"A STIS spectrum of the galaxy NGC 4151 revealing that gas is flowing out of a black hole in its center.\" /></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>A STIS spectrum of the galaxy NGC 4151 revealing that gas is flowing out of a black hole in its center.</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em><img src=\"/static/about/img/stis_205.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" alt=\"A STIS image of stars in the elliptical galaxy NGC 205 together with stars in the foreground from our own Milky Way.

Compared to its predecessor, it offers  improved resolution over a wider field of view.&nbsp;  In terms of overall performance, it will offer comparable performance to  the <a href=\"/about/general/instruments/acs/\">ACS</a> instrument, but over a wider range of wavelengths. The combination of these two elements &ndash;  enhanced field of view and broader waveband &ndash; makes for a powerful instrument.</p>\r\n <h2>Technology</h2><p>The instrument has two channels one for ultraviolet and visible light (UVIS) and the other for near infrared (NIR).  In both cases, the detectors are the solid-state devices.  For the UVIS channel a silicon based CCD, similar to those found in digital cameras, is used.  The similarities end there, however, as the CCD on WFC3 is a 16 megapixel, high sensitivity, low noise array.  These high performance chips are made by e2V, a Uk based company, who specialise in the fabrication of large, high-performance, detector arrays for use in space.  For the NIR channel, a 1 megapixel array made from the exotic material of mercuric cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) is used.  The combination of these two technologies gives WFC3 its performance over an broad range of wavelengths.

Their job is entirely to evaluate the\ntechnical and scientific content of the paper. 3) Provided that the internal\nreview board also 'accepts' the paper, we start preparing the first draft for\nthe actual press release. This is done in close collaboration with the original\nauthors, but may also involve other parties (graphics specialists, media\npeople, etc.). 4) The draft press release is evaluated again by the internal\nreview board. This time their task is to spot possible scientific mistakes or\nexpressions in the release that might cause misunderstandings.\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\"The media &#8211; also in Europe &#8211;\ngives priority to NASA news and we have the impression that the media accepts\nnearly all that is published by NASA &#8211; because of this we have little\nchance to be heard if we send out a press release on a particular topic at the\nsame time as NASA.\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\"When at the time of the ESOF International\nScientific Conference we published the press release about the extrasolar\nplanet in orbit around <i>\u00b5 Arae</i></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, we made sure to\nmake the journalists aware of fact that this particular press release was based\non a submitted, but not yet accepted, paper. The urgency of publishing this\nrelease was due to series of external factors, but the scientific paper was in\nfact accepted shortly thereafter. This did not seem to bother journalists, but\nlater at a press conference in the US we were heavily criticized for this\n&#8211; though indeed not by the journalists!\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\"Given that NASA quite often appears to\nmake news announcements, which are not supported by an accepted paper &#8211;\nwhich can of course be justified in the case of a scientific meeting for\nexample &#8211; we're indeed puzzled by criticism from NASA when, on rare occasions,\nwe publish a press release based on a submitted but still-to-be accepted\nscience paper.\" </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\"Credibility is a principal asset of ours.\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\"Press work is work 'in the fast lane'.\nOccasionally, the lengthy procedures that we follow at ESO to prepare a press\nrelease, including the time needed for our scientists to verify our statements,\nentails the risk that we might be 'scooped' by others.

The issue is confidence. It is important to remember that\ngreat advances always have two sides.

Q: When trying to open an image I get an &quot;out of memory (RAM)&quot; error message.</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A:</strong> This problem is usually caused by not installing the support files libtbb.dylib and libtbbmalloc.dylib. These files should be installed in /usr/lib.<br />\r\n                <br />\r\n              Alternatively the plug-in may have incorrect file permissions. Check that icon for FITS Liberator.plugin file is the same as for the other plug-ins. If not delete the plug-in and install it again.</p>\r\n              <p><strong>7. Q: Why can't I open my FITS image?</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong>A:</strong> There might be a couple of reasons:</p>\r\n              <ol>\r\n                <li>Maybe this image is stored inside a compressed archive like a zip archive. FITS Liberator does not support opening images directly from a compressed archive. Try extracting the image before opening it.</li>\r\n                <li> Maybe the filename contains characters that FITS Liberator cannot handle. FITS Liberator only supports filenames  that contain characters from the ASCII table (regular english characters and numbers). Try renaming the image to a simple name before opening it (note, same applies to directories on the path in which the file are stored).</li></ol>\r\n<p><strong>6. Q: Why did you choose to support Photoshop?</strong> </p>\r\n              <p><strong>A</strong>: We chose Photoshop for a variety of reasons: </p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li>Photoshop is a state-of-the-art image processing package and                     is in our opinion the best available.</li>\r\n                <li>Photoshop is widely accepted as 'industry standard' for professional                     graphics artists.</li>\r\n                <li>Photoshop CS works completely natively with 16 bit files.                     Most astronomical observations are 16 bits or more, so before                     we could not exploit the full dynamic information in the images.                     The 16 bits we have access to now has a great impact on quality                     of the colour images that are composed.</li>\r\n                <li>Photoshop has a large development community and the software                     is therefore always in rapid development.</li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p>If you do not want to use Photoshop there is a free java image                   package that can read FITS images called ImageJ. It's based on                   the older NIH Image program from the 90's and is free: <a href=\"http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/\">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</a> . To our knowledge this is the only cross-platform completely                   free software that handles FITS files. </p>\r\n              <p>We do not have plans to support GIMP, PaintShop Pro or others.                   For Linux users it should also be possible to run Photoshop, see                   this <a href=\"http://www.desktoplinux.com/articles/AT7770280571.html\">article</a>.<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p><strong>5. Q: After downloading and trying the FITS Liberator,                   I was wondering if there existed a similar, easy, image-alignment                   tool.</strong> </p>\r\n              <p><strong>A: </strong>Good point. To our knowledge it does not                   exist for Photoshop, although it would be an obvious place to                   have it here. The tool we use is <a href=\"http://www.aurigaimaging.com/\">Registar</a>.                   We are investigating whether it is feasible to develop a registration                   tool for Photoshop. Follow, or participate in, the development                   by checking the draft specifications for v.2 that will soon be                   available in the menu to the left. </p>\r\n              <p><strong>4. Q: Photoshop CS is too expensive. Are there other                   options?</strong> </p>\r\n              <p><strong>A: </strong>You can also use <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopel/main.html\">Photoshop                   Elements 2.0</a>. It costs around 99$, Note: it does only support                   8 bit (which should be enough in most cases). </p>\r\n              <p><strong>3. Q: The Photoshop action script does not download as                   expected on a Mac.</strong> </p>\r\n              <p><strong>A</strong>: You have to &quot;save linked file as&quot;,                   i.e. Alt-click on the file. </p>\r\n              <p><strong>2: Q: I seem to have problems installing the plug-in                   with a non-English Photoshop.</strong> </p>\r\n              <p><strong>A:</strong> Indeed. We are aware of this and are working                   on a solution. </p>\r\n              <p><strong>1. Q: Are you planning on releasing the source code? </strong> </p>\r\n              <p><strong>A</strong>: In most cases the answer would be that we                   are not allowed to do this due to our contract with Adobe Systems.                   There is however a possibility to perhaps share code if you apply                   for, and become, an <a href=\"http://partners.adobe.com/asn/photoshop/index.jsp\">Adobe                   SDK developer</a>. Note that we have used NASA's <a href=\"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html\">CFITSIO</a> for the FITS routines and these are public. </p>\r\n              <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This scientific goal was so important that it put constraints  on the lower limit of the size of Hubble&rsquo;s primary mirror. Cepheids are a  special type of variable star with very stable and predictable brightness  variations. The period of these variations depends on physical properties of  the stars such as their mass and true brightness. This means that astronomers,  just by looking at the variability of their light, can find out about the  Cepheids&rsquo; physical nature, which then can be used very effectively to determine  their distance. For this reason cosmologists call Cepheids &lsquo;standard candles&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>Astronomers have used Hubble to observe Cepheids with extraordinary results.  The Cepheids have then been used as stepping-stones to make distance  measurements for supernov&aelig;, which have, in turn, given a measure for the scale  of the Universe. Today we know the age of the Universe to a much higher  precision than before Hubble: around 15 billion years.</p>\n<table width=\"336\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tr>\n<td width=\"328\"><a href=\"/images/opo9919a/\"><img src=\"/static/archives/images/medium/opo9919a.jpg\" alt=\"Spiral galaxy NGC 4603 containing Cepheids being used for distance measurements.\" width=\"320\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Spiral galaxy NGC 4603 containing Cepheids being used for distance measurements. </em></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><p class=\"style2\"><strong>Gustav A.

Hubble has made enormous progress possible within cosmology. Today we have \r\n\t\t\ta much more unified cosmological picture than was possible even five years ago when people were talking of &lsquo;The \r\n\t\t\tCosmology in Crisis&rsquo;. We have seen a dramatic change from misery to glory!&quot;</em></span></td>\n<td width=\"7%\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong><em>The expansion of the Universe</em></strong><br />\r\nOne of Hubble&rsquo;s initial &lsquo;core&rsquo; purposes was to determine the rate of expansion  of the Universe, known to astronomers as the &ldquo;Hubble Constant&rdquo;. After eight  years of Cepheid observations this work was concluded by finding that the  expansion increases with 70 km/second for every 3.26 million light-years you  look further out into space. </p>\n<p>Hubble&rsquo;s <a href=\"/about/general/instruments/acs/\">sharp  vision</a> means that it can see exploding stars, supernovae that are billions  of light years away and difficult for other telescopes to study. A supernova  image from the ground usually blends in with the image of its host galaxy.  Hubble can distinguish the light from the two sources and thus measure the  supernova directly. </p>\n<p>For many years cosmologists have discussed whether the  expansion of the Universe would stop in some distant future or continue ever  more slowly. From the new supernova results it seems clear that the expansion  is nowhere near slowing down. In fact, due to some mysterious property of space  itself, called dark energy, the expansion is accelerating and will continue  forever. This surprising conclusion came from combined measurements of remote  supernovae with most of the world&rsquo;s top-class telescopes, including Hubble.  Furthermore recent supernova results indicate that cosmos did not always  accelerate, but began accelerating when the Universe was less than half its  current age.<br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<table border=\"0\" align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/images/opo9919i/\"><img src=\"/static/archives/images/news/opo9919i.jpg\" alt=\"Supernova 1994D (lower left)\" width=\"180\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Supernova 1994D (lower left)</em></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><p class=\"style2\"><strong>Bruno Leibundgut<br />\n</strong>Astronomer, European Southern Observatory (ESO)</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"7%\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"86%\"><span class=\"style2\"><em>&quot;Hubble gave us the distance measurements of the first four supernovae that made us realise something was wrong with our present \r\n\t\t\tunderstanding of the Universe.

It will generate a single WFPC2 mosaic'ed file from one WFPC2 file containing four CCD images in individual planes.<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>Stretch Functions<br />\r\n                -----------------</p>\r\n              <p>Users of version 2.0 of the ESA/ESO/NASA FITS Liberator will find the interface nearly unchanged. The most signifcant change is to the stretch function menu:</p>\r\n              <p>- The functions have been reorganized into more logical groupings</p>\r\n              <p>- The square and cube root functions have been renamed x^(1/2) and x^(1/3)</p>\r\n              <p>- Fourth and fifth root functions have been added: x^(1/4), x^(1/5)</p>\r\n              <p>- New compound functions have been added: ArcSinh(ArcSinh(x)), ArcSinh(x^(1/2))</p>\r\n              <p>Since the ArcSinh function is similar in effect to Log, but is well-behaved around zero it has been promoted to a lead position in the menu.<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>Metadata Pane (FITS Liberator)<br />\r\n                ------------------------------</p>\r\n              <p>This pane in the FITS Liberator interface has been reworked to support version 1.0 of the Astronomy Visualization Metadata standard. Much of this work is not directly visible to the user, but reflects updates to the way the metadata is stored internally.</p>\r\n              <p>One benefit to the new data format is that many fields identifying the creator and content information (contacts, headline, description, etc.) will also be available under the matching IPTC fields, and thus easily read within a variety of image processing and cataloging programs that access these fields. The astronomy-specific fields may not be available in many other packages at this time, however.</p>\r\n              <p>Mac users: Note that you may lose information in the last metadata field in which you were typing if you click &quot;OK&quot; while the cursor is still blinking in that field. To keep that infomration, click outside of the text box before clicking the &quot;OK&quot; button to import the FITS image and metadata.</p>\r\n              <p>For more information about the Astronomy Visualization Metadata standard, go to:</p>\r\n              <p>http://www.communicatingastronomy.org/avm/1.0/<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>Metadata Panels (File Info...

These panels can be installed using a separate application included with the distribution. They will appear near the top of the list as the panels:</p>\r\n              <p>Astro Creator<br />\r\n                Astro Content<br />\r\n                Astro Observation<br />\r\n                Astro Coordinates<br />\r\n                Astro Publisher<br />\r\n                Astro FITS Liberator</p>\r\n              <p>The information can be freely edited in the File Info... dialog box, but there is limited syntax-checking. Fields that should use only elements from a controlled vocabulary of a limited number of choices (like Subject.Category, Spectral.ColorAssignment, etc.) should be entered carefully. These fields will be restricted to the accepted values if set using the FITS Liberator plugin.</p>\r\n              <p>Fields that contain multiple values will be marked with an asterisk. Values should be separated by a semi-colon (&quot;;&quot;) character.</p>\r\n              <p>Many fields will keep a history of recently-used values that can simplify data entry. These show up as pop-up lists via the small triangular icon at the right side of the text field. </p>\r\n              <p>Dates should adhere to the following formatting in this dialog box:</p>\r\n              <p> Astro Content&gt;Date: MM/DD/YYYY (it will display as MM/DD/YY)<br />\r\n  Astro Observation&gt;Temporal.StartTime: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM</p>\r\n              <p>Note that any information that was entered using version 2.0 of the FITS Liberator will not be accessible once version 2.1 is installed. </p>\r\n              <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n              <p>------------------------------<br />\r\n                FITS Concatenator Usage Notes<br />\r\n                ------------------------------</p>\r\n              <p>The ESA/ESO/NASA FITS Concatenator script (found under File&gt;Scripts&gt;FITS Concatenator) is a utility to simplify the process of combining individual grescale images into a single document. It does two things:</p>\r\n              <p> Copy each open image into its own layer</p>\r\n              <p> Concatenate/Consolidate all of the metadata fields<br />\r\n                  <br />\r\n                  The script combines ALL open windows and the original images are closed. Only the combined layered document remains. Note that this can NOT be undone; it is safer to save all open images before running this script.</p>\r\n              <p>There are several notes/caveats on the way the metadata fields (accessed from the FITS Liberator Metadata tab or the File&gt;File Info... dialog) are combined:</p>\r\n              <p>1. Single-valued fields retain the values from the last file opened.</p>\r\n              <p>2. Multi-valued fields contain all entries concatenated together.</p>\r\n              <p>2.1 There is no duplication-checking on entries; identical instances of e.g. Subject.Name, Subject.Category will appear as duplicates and will need to be deleted by hand.</p>\r\n              <p>3. WCS coordinates are taken from the last file opened.</p>\r\n              <p>3.1 Spatial.Quality is automatically set to &quot;Undefined&quot; as a reminder to revalidate the coordinates after combining images.</p>\r\n              <p>3.2 Currently the Spatial.CDMatrix field will contain all entried from all files concatenated together. Only the final four will reflect the same coordinate solution of the other fields. This will be fixed in a future release.<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>-----------------------------------<br />\r\n                Colour Composite Action Usage Notes<br />\r\n                -----------------------------------</p>\r\n              <p>A set of colour utility actions will be installed in Photoshop's Presets folder. To make them available for use, choose the &quot;Colour_Composite&quot; selection from the pop-up menu available under the small triangle at the top of the Actions palette tab. If the Actions palette is not visible, it can be displayed from the Window Menu.</p>\r\n              <p>Once selected from the pop-up, three new actions will be added to your actions palette:</p>\r\n              <p> RED Layer<br />\r\n  GREEN Layer<br />\r\n  BLUE Layer</p>\r\n              <p>These are shortcuts for assigning colors to a multichannel image. They should be used on a document with two or more greyscale layers from different FITS files. This could be the result of running the FITS Concatenator script on several open windows, or of manually copying layers into a single document.</p>\r\n              <p>To use the actions, select a greyscale layer in the Layer's palette then run one of them (in Button Mode, this is done with a single click, otherwise you select the action then click the triangular &quot;Run&quot; button at the bottom of the palette).</p>\r\n              <p>The selected layer will be colourized with a grouped Hue/Saturation adjustment layer. Intervening Levels and Curves will also be added, allowing quick adjustments. The coluor can be further adjusted by double-clicking the Hue/Saturation adjustment layer and moving the Hue slider.<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>----------------<br />\r\n                WFPC2 Mosaicator<br />\r\n                ----------------</p>\r\n              <p>This utility is only intended for users working with data from the WFPC2 instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope.

Planners needed answers to three main questions in order to accommodate the repairs in the mission schedule: </em><br />\n</p>\n<ul><li>How to access circuit boards hidden behind panels containing requiring removal of over 100 screws</li>\n<li>What new tools would be needed to make it easier for astronauts to complete the tasks</li>\n<li>How to quickly seal the instruments when finished without compromising requirements</li></ul>\n<p>Knowing exactly what needs fixing is not enough to make repairs straightforward. To access the failed circuit boards on these two instruments, astronauts have to remove 111 screws from the cover of STIS, and 32 screws from ACS, a time-consuming process in an environment where time is a scarce commodity.</p>\n<p>To overcome this challenge, Goddard engineers developed a high-speed power screwdriver with low torque, or twisting force. This combination of operational abilities means that the drill will speed up the removal process without breaking the screws and fasteners.</p>\n<p>Hubble&rsquo;s instruments are extremely delicate and any floating debris poses a real threat to exposed electronics, so as astronauts open Hubble&rsquo;s outer shell to make their repairs they must exercise extreme caution. </p>\n<p>To avoid floating debris, NASA engineers designed the fastener capture plate. Using the custom drill, astronauts will first remove four outer screws to install the transparent capture plate over the electronic access panel. Tiny, labelled holes in the plate will allow them to then insert the drill bit and remove screws as the capture plate contains them. At the end, the entire capture plate is released as one unit, safely taking the access panel and all the debris away from Hubble.</p>\n<p>The second challenge is grasping the circuit boards. The boards are thin and the astronaut&rsquo;s suits, including their gloves, are bulky and pressurized. If you were to put on a pair of thick, wool mittens and try to grab a single piece of paper from the middle of a stack, you might have some idea of how difficult and time-consuming the task is for astronauts. NASA engineers got around this issue by developing a special card extraction tool that allows the astronauts to easily grab and remove the circuit boards.</p>\n<p>The last major challenge of the repair process involves closing the instruments. To conserve time, engineers designed a simplified version of the access panels. Two lever-like latches will be all it takes for the astronauts to securely lock the new STIS cover into place. A new panel is not required for ACS because the new electronic cards are in a single box that easily slides into place and covers the open side of the instrument.</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n",

Planners needed answers to three main questions in order to accommodate the repairs in the mission schedule: </em><br />\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to access circuit boards hidden behind panels, requiring the removal of over 100 screws;</li>\n<li>What new tools would be needed to make it easier for astronauts to complete the tasks;</li>\n<li>How to quickly seal the instruments when finished without compromising requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Knowing exactly what needs fixing is not enough to make repairs straightforward. To access the failed circuit boards on these two instruments, astronauts have to remove 111 screws from the cover of STIS, and 32 screws from ACS, a lengthy process in an environment where time is a scarce commodity.</p>\n<p>To overcome this challenge, Goddard engineers developed a high-speed power screwdriver with low torque, or twisting force. This combination of operational abilities means that the drill will speed up the removal process without breaking the screws or fasteners.</p>\n<p>Hubble&rsquo;s instruments are extremely delicate and any floating debris poses a real threat to exposed electronics. So, as astronauts open Hubble&rsquo;s outer shell to make their repairs, they must exercise extreme caution. </p>\n<p>To avoid floating debris, NASA engineers designed the fastener capture plate. Using the custom drill, astronauts will first remove four outer screws to install the transparent capture plate over the electronic access panel. Tiny, labelled holes in the plate will allow them to then insert the drill bit and remove screws as the capture plate contains them. At the end, the entire capture plate is released as one unit, safely taking the access panel and all the debris away from Hubble.</p>\n<p>The second challenge is grasping the circuit boards. These are very thin, but the astronauts' suits, including their gloves, are bulky and pressurised. If you were to put on a pair of thick, woollen mittens before trying to grab a single piece of paper from the middle of a stack, you might have some idea of how difficult and time-consuming the task is for astronauts. NASA engineers got around this issue by developing a special card extraction tool that allows the astronauts to easily grab and remove the circuit boards.</p>\n<p>The last major challenge of the repair process involves closing the instruments. To conserve time, engineers designed a simplified version of the access panels. Two lever-like latches will be all it takes for the astronauts to securely lock the new STIS cover into place. A new panel is not required for ACS because the fresh electronic cards are in a single box that easily slides into place and covers the open side of the instrument.</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n",

In the case of Nicmos, cooling is produced by solid nitrogen at -196&deg; C, encased in an advanced thermos flask system.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Unfortunately Nicmos' lifetime was reduced from the expected 4.5 years to about 2, due to a problem in the cooling system. The sides of the thermos flask touched and as a result the solid nitrogen inside heated up and evaporated, so that by January 1999 all the coolant nitrogen had disappeared and Nicmos could no longer operate.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Once the problem was recognised the Space Telescope scheduling was adjusted in such a way that Nicmos observations were assigned to as much as 40-50% of the total observing time during the first period of observations after the instrument was installed. In this way the Nicmos science programme was completed despite the instrument's dramatically shortened lifetime.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>But at last, after this enforced shutdown, Nicmos has been revived. Astronauts retrofitted it with a new, experimental cooling system that returned it to active duty. By fitting Nicmos with this refrigerator-like cooling system, it is again possible to re-cool the detectors to -196&ordm; C (77&deg; K), thereby reawakening their infrared vision and extending the instrument's life by several years.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>The super-quiet cooler (called the Nicmos CryoCooler - NCC) uses ultra-high-speed microturbines, spinning up to more than 400,000 rpm (revolutions per minute)- over 100 times the revolutions of a typical car engine). Hubble's engineering team successfully demonstrated this technology in 1998 during another Shuttle mission in the first on-orbit test of this high-performance, high-efficiency, mechanical cryocooler.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>In the past Nicmos has produced excellent science and astronomers are looking forward to working with this top class instrument again.</p></td>\r\n\t\t<td width=\"38%\" valign=\"top\"><p><img src=\"/static/about/img/sm3bNICMOSXCryocooler.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"273\" alt=\"The very advanced Nicmos CryoCooler designed to cool Nicmos onboard Hubble.\" /></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>The very advanced Nicmos CryoCooler designed to cool Nicmos onboard Hubble.</em></p></td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n",

            "content": "<h1>Operating Hubble</h1>\n\r\n<p>\tThe science operations are co-ordinated and conducted by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore. The overall\r\n\tmanagement of daily on-orbit operations is based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Hubble's science instruments act as the astronomer's electronic eyes. Light hits the primary mirror, is reflected onto the secondary mirror and\r\n\tfrom there passes through a small opening in the primary mirror to the focal plane. The focal plane is the size and shape of a dinner plate and is shared by the scientific instruments which sample light and record the information. Once the telescope observes a celestial object, its\r\n\tonboard computers convert the image or data into long strings of numbers which are sent down to Earth via the Tracking and Data Relay\r\n\tSatellite System (TDRSS). From TDRSS the data are sent to the TDRSS ground station and on to the Goddard Space Flight Center.\r\n\tNASA's Goddard Space Flight Center then forwards the data over landlinks to the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in\r\n\tBaltimore on the east coast of the United States where it is reconverted into data and images, analysed and stored. Observers can then study the data at STScI or at their home institutions. </p>\r\n<p>The telescope operates 24 hours a day. However, scheduling is tricky. At certain times of the year a celestial object may not be visible\r\n\tbecause it appears too close to the Sun. Furthermore, Hubble is not in constant communication with the ground stations. Consequently,\r\n\ttechnicians must plan each observation down to the second, telling the telescope what to do and when, using detailed computer-coded\r\n\tinstructions transmitted to and stored inside the telescope's onboard computer. </p>\r\n<p>Although Hubble operates around the clock, not all of its time is spent observing. Each orbit lasts about 97 minutes, with time allocated for\r\n\thousekeeping functions and for observations. &quot;Housekeeping&quot; functions include turning the telescope to acquire a new target, or avoiding\r\n\tthe Sun or Moon, switching communications antennae and data transmission modes, receiving command loads and downlinking data,\r\n\tcalibrating and similar activities. </p>\r\n<p>When STScI completes its master observing plan, the schedule is forwarded to Goddard's Space Telescope Operations Control Center\r\n\t(STOCC), where the science and housekeeping plans are merged into a detailed operations schedule. Each event is translated into a\r\n\tseries of commands to be sent to the onboard computers. Computer loads are uplinked several times a day to keep the telescope\r\n\toperating efficiently. </p>\r\n<p>Whenever possible two scientific instruments are used simultaneously to observe adjacent target regions of the sky. For example, while a\r\n\tspectrograph is focused on a chosen star or nebula, WFPC2 can image a sky region offset slightly from the main viewing target. During\r\n\tobservations the Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) track their respective guide stars to keep the telescope pointed steadily at the right target. </p>\r\n<p>If an astronomer wishes to be present during the observation, there is a console at STScI and another at the STOCC, where monitors\r\n\tdisplay images or other data as the observations occur. Some limited real-time commands for target acquisition or filter changing can be\r\n\tgiven from these stations, if the observation program has been set up to allow for it, but spontaneous control is not possible. </p>\r\n<p>Before the Hubble Space Telescope can make any kind of observation, it must find a pair of guide stars located alongside the\r\n\tobservational target. To find these direction beacons, mission planners refer to an immense catalogue, Hubble Guide Star Catalogue, containing the sky 'addresses' of 15 million stars . </p>\r\n<p>Since its launch in 1990, Hubble has made 97 percent of its scheduled observations. The other three percent - usually missed because of\r\n\tminor equipment malfunctions - are rescheduled to later dates. </p>\r\n",

The growing impact of technology has brought science ever more into our daily lives. However, without a general awareness of science in the public domain and a lack of a broad appreciation of scientific progress, the public is left with nothing to counterbalance the pervasive influence of mystical beliefs.</p>\r\n              <p> There are many good reasons for scientists to participate in science communication:</p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li> To expose the work of his/her specific community. </li>\r\n                <li> To highlight a specific result. </li>\r\n                <li> To highlight the work of an institution. </li>\r\n                <li> To highlight the work of a group. </li>\r\n                <li> To highlight individual efforts. </li>\r\n                <li> To acknowledge a sponsor. </li>\r\n                <li> To benefit the scientific community as a whole (a sense of duty). </li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p> In the following sections you will find the most important information about one of the fundamental instruments of science communication: The press release.</p>\r\n              <ol>\r\n                <li><strong> <a href=\"#1\">The press release</a> </strong></li>\r\n                <li> <a href=\"#2\"><strong>The main goals of press releases </strong></a></li>\r\n                <li><strong> </strong><a href=\"#3\"><strong>Different types of press releases</strong></a></li>\r\n                <li><strong> </strong><a href=\"#4\"><strong>Visual support </strong></a></li>\r\n                <li><strong> </strong><a href=\"#5\"><strong>News criteria</strong></a></li>\r\n                <li><strong><a href=\"#6\">How to write a press release </a></strong></li>\r\n                <li><strong> </strong><a href=\"#7\"><strong>Some brief advice for science writing</strong></a></li>\r\n              </ol>\r\n              <br />\r\n              <hr />\r\n              <br />              \r\n              <p><strong> &nbsp;</strong><strong>1.<a name=\"1\" id=\"1\"></a> The press release </strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong> &nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Press releases&rdquo; are one of the main vehicles used by a communication office to inform the world about scientific advances. Naturally the results themselves should make a press release, but a few simple guidelines can help to make the release a success. Although the main target group for press releases is the press, press releases do reach further. Press releases communicate important information to decision-makers, other mediators, scientists and even to the public. It is critically important always to tailor the style, level and content of a press release to suit the needs of the press and not the secondary target groups mentioned. </p>\r\n              <p> Typically, the institution is involved either through its scientists or a project managed by the institution. A close collaboration with the scientist (the Principal Investigator) is vital for the practical work. He or she can help, either by supplying a short text describing the result in simple terms, or by explaining the situation over the phone. </p>\r\n              <p> The Public Information Officer co-operates with the scientist to draft the press release. Once the scientist has approved the release it is often sent to an internal editorial board that reviews the political and scientific issues. </p>\r\n              <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n              <p> <strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><a name=\"2\" id=\"2\"></a>2. The main goals of press releases </strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong> &nbsp;</strong>As with other types of public science communication the press release has to fulfil three main goals:</p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li> To increase awareness of science and the scientific work process </li>\r\n                <li> To increase awareness of the organisation </li>\r\n                <li> To increase awareness of specific scientific projects, instruments or missions </li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong> <a name=\"3\" id=\"3\"></a>3. Different types of press releases </strong></p>\r\n              <p> Three significant, different types of releases exist: </p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li> News release: focuses on one or more scientific discoveries </li>\r\n                <li> Photo release: contains &ldquo;pretty pictures&rdquo;, but no big discovery </li>\r\n                <li> Video release: Some news releases are accompanied by a Video News Release (VNR). A VNR is a press release in video form designed for use on broadcast television or on websites &mdash; as a news item or feature story. VNRs translate the printed word into the sound and pictures television newsrooms need. </li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p> In most cases any written release will be accompanied by high-quality photos and a video. </p>\r\n              <p><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong> <a name=\"4\" id=\"4\"></a>4. Visual support </strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong> &nbsp;</strong>Images, illustrations and visual design are key factors in successful science communication. The effort needed here can hardly be overemphasised. It is true that all good science communication is based on good science, but without good visuals the chances of selling the products vanish. Images have always been an integral part of science, but two factors have contributed to increase the importance of images in particular: the advent of computers and the continuing decrease in the attention span of the average human. </p>\r\n              <p> We work closely with the scientist to create the best possible visuals, either as artist&rsquo;s impressions drawn from raw data from Hubble or as videos. </p>\r\n              <p><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n              <p><strong> <a name=\"5\" id=\"5\"></a>5. News criteria </strong></p>\r\n              <p> How can the newsworthiness of a given scientific finding be judged? </p>\r\n              <p> Assess whether the story fulfils one or more of the following news criteria:</p>\r\n              <ol>\r\n                <li> Timing : The story is &lsquo;news&rsquo; (the event has just taken place). </li>\r\n                <li> Relevance : An issue that has direct or near-direct influence on people&rsquo;s lives such as fatalities and material damage. </li>\r\n                <li> Proximity : The story has local appeal or local interest (happened in the town or the country). </li>\r\n                <li> Implications : A result that has profound consequences. </li>\r\n                <li> Conflict : Settles a controversial debate or a much-debated topic that contains intrigues. </li>\r\n                <li> Human interest : For instance &ldquo;Astronomer discovers new galaxies while raising three children and teaching women&rsquo;s self-defence class in her spare time.&rdquo; </li>\r\n                <li> Mystery : A mysterious phenomenon, quirky details, an unexpected result or a chance discovery. </li>\r\n                <li> Major science : Represents a major discovery of a new phenomenon or class of object or an incremental gain in knowledge about a principal field of research. </li>\r\n                <li> New interesting angle : Twisting an old result in a new way, such as a new, better image that confirms a known result. </li>\r\n                <li> A record : First, largest, most distant, fastest, oldest &hellip;. </li>\r\n                <li> A sexy topic : Some topics almost always capture the attention of the public (despite not necessarily being great science) and therefore have a fast track to the headlines. Some examples from astronomy are: Solar System topics, space weather, black holes, extrasolar planets, extraterrestrial life, the future of the Earth and Sun and human spaceflight. </li>\r\n                <li> Aesthetics : such as an exceptionally beautiful image. </li>\r\n                <li> Publication in a distinguished journal : Results published in, for example, Nature or Science tend to attract more interest from journalists. </li>\r\n                <li> Crosslinking : Letting a result piggyback on another news story in a related, parallel or even a remotely related field. </li>\r\n              </ol>\r\n              <p>&nbsp; </p>\r\n              <p><strong> <a name=\"6\" id=\"6\"></a>6. Checklist for scientists </strong></p>\r\n              <ol>\r\n                <li> <strong>Hot or Not?</strong>: If you think you have a good science result, check with the list of News Criteria above to see if your result is likely to interest the press and the public. </li>\r\n                <li> <strong>Be proactive:</strong> If your science fulfils one or more of these news criteria, do not hesitate to tell us about it. If we, here at ESA/Hubble, consider your story &ldquo;hot&rdquo; we can help you in many ways. </li>\r\n                <li> <strong>Participate in the process:</strong> Work with us to prepare a press release. Be prepared to spend some time explaining the science and to make the proper information available to the science communicator here. </li>\r\n                <li> <strong>Involve other institutions:</strong> The Public Information Officer (PIO) here will interface with PIOs of other institutions that have participated in the work, possibly proposing a simultaneous co-release. </li>\r\n                <li> <strong>Create images:</strong> Some sort of eye-catching image or illustration to accompany the press release is practically mandatory. Work with us to create appealing and correct imagery</li>\r\n                <li> <strong>Add value:</strong> Many scientists like to make a more specialised webpage containing additional information, translations of the press release into other languages, additional images, graphs, technical movies etc. Scientists are sometimes in a better position to interface with local media and often have a much more detailed knowledge about them than us. </li>\r\n              </ol>\r\n              <p>&nbsp; </p>\r\n              <p><strong> <a name=\"7\" id=\"7\"></a>7. Some brief advice for science writing</strong></p>\r\n              <p> When writing a draft for a press release it may be worthwhile to have a glance at some standard advice for science writing in general.</p>\r\n              <ol>\r\n                <li>  <strong>Prepare properly: </strong>It is important to set boundary conditions regarding the topic, the length, the target group and the style.</li>\r\n                <li><strong> Do your research:</strong> Start by answering the six golden questions: What? When? Where? Who?Why? and How?<strong></strong>\r\n                  <ul>\r\n                    <li> - Scan the current scientific literature on the topic </li>\r\n                    <li> - Review your own writing on the topic </li>\r\n                    <li> - Mine the web </li>\r\n                  </ul>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li><strong> Structure your thinking:</strong> For example, brainstorm the topic: Check if some of the elements are connected in patterns that may help you choose your angle. </li>\r\n                <li><strong> Relax: </strong>It is often suggested that a writer should <em>relax </em>and not be too concerned about the needs of the reader in order to sound genuine. </li>\r\n                <li>  <strong>Be consistent:</strong> Follow some consistent writing guideline, either of your own choice or imposed by the system (for instance via your organisation&rsquo;s style guide), for example: Spelling, Grammar etc.</li>\r\n                <li>  <strong>Simplify:</strong> A fundamental rule of written science communication is to make texts as simple as possible. Nowadays people simply do not have time for lengthy explanations.</li>\r\n                <li><strong> Explain:</strong> It is always necessary to match the writing to the level of the target group, but never more so than in science writing. Remember that &ldquo;the reader knows nothing&rdquo;. Always spell out abbreviations. Build up your explanations from the lowest level, but try not to patronise, and avoid being overly didactic. The educational aspects go unnoticed in the best communication. </li>\r\n                <li><strong> Edit: </strong>Re-reading and editing a text always improves its quality. Especially if the editor is someone other than the author.</li>\r\n                <li> <strong>Modern aids:</strong>  Several useful features in modern word processing software make life easier for authors, for example spellcheckers and thesauruses. </li>\r\n              </ol>\r\n              <p><strong><br />\r\n              Contact Information</strong></p>\r\n              <p>Colleen Sharkey <br />\r\n                ESA Hubble Space Telescope Outreach Coordinator/PIO <br />\r\n                ESO Education and Outreach Department <br />\r\n                Tel: +49 89 3200 6306 <br />\r\n  <a href=\"mailto:csharkey@eso.org\">csharkey@eso.org</a></p>\r\n              <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n              ",

The latter is                    furthermore uncompressed and therefore completely uncompromised                    and unrivaled in quality.\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/images/\">Image archive</a>: Our archive contains                    all the Hubble images - both American and European - that has                    been released publicly. The quality of the high-res versions                    of the images are the<em> best available, </em>and in 97% of                    the cases completely uncompromised information coming directly                    from Hubble (without compression and other degradation). Some                    of the images may seem small (low resolution), but remember                    that they usually are the sharpest, best and highest resolution                    images of the given object available anywhere. Note also that                    nearly all of these images have been used on large posters,                    banners in sizes up to several metres (and even house-size in                    some cases).</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/public/news/archive/embargo/\">Embargo Site</a>: For members of                    the press we have made a special embargo area that gives access                    to News and Photo Releases ahead of the publication date.

Gyroscopes are important because they measure the rate of motion as Hubble moves and help ensure the telescope retains correct pointing during observations. </em></p>\n<h2>How Gyroscopes Work</h2>\n<p>Gyroscopes maintain orientation and provide stability in boats, aircraft and spacecraft based on the principles of angular momentum.  You can experience this effect by holding a bicycle wheel by its axle and asking someone to spin the wheel. If you try to move the axle of the spinning wheel, you will feel a force opposing your attempt to move it. This force is similar to the one produced in the gyroscopes when Hubble moves.</p>\n<p>Each gyroscope contains a wheel spinning at 19,200 revolutions per minute inside a sealed cylinder. This cylinder is immersed in a thick, motor-oil-like fluid. Fine, hair-like wires, surrounded by this thick fluid, carry electricity to the motor. Oxygen-pressurized air, used to force the thick fluid into the float cavity that contains these wires, has corroded the wires and caused them to break. Pressurized nitrogen, used in the new gyroscopes, will eliminate the introduction of corrosive oxygen.</p>\n<h2>The Best Gyroscopes in the World</h2>\n<p>Several different types of gyroscopes are available: mechanical using ball bearings; other designs using light or the frequency of a resonating hemisphere to detect movement; and gas bearings.  Of these only gas-bearing gyroscopes offer the combination of extremely low noise with very high stability and resolution. Gas-bearing gyroscopes are the most accurate in the world and Hubble uses the best available. </p>\n<p>Hubble&rsquo;s gyroscopes are extraordinarily stable and can detect even extremely small movements. When used with other fine-pointing devices, they keep the telescope precisely pointed for long periods, enabling Hubble to produce its spectacular views of the Universe.</p>\n<h2>Rate Sensor Units</h2><p>Each Rate Sensor Unit (RSU) contains two gyroscopes.  When astronauts replace failed gyroscopes they always replace a single RSU.  In 1993 on the first servicing mission, astronauts changed two units.  In 1999, they changed all three units.  In SM4 astronauts will, once again, upgrade all 3 of the RSU.</p>\n<h2>How many are needed?</h2>\n<p>At any given time, Hubble needs three of its six gyroscopes operating to ensure optimal efficiency. In August 2005, Hubble began operating in a new two-gyro mode to extend the telescope&rsquo;s life and ensure it had at least two functioning gyroscopes until Servicing Mission 4. Although the telescope can operate on only two gyroscopes, the regions of the sky that on view are limited.</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n",

The 3rd generation imager included three channels: the Wide Field Channel (WFC), the High Resolution Channel (HRC), and the Solar Blind Channel (SBC).  In July 2006, an electronics failure in its Low Voltage Power Supply (LVPS) effectively placed the WFC and HRC offline.</em></p>\r\n<h2>The Fix</h2>\r\n<P>The attempted repair of ACS during this mission will restore the WFC by replacing four boards within the existing electronics bay by a single new power supply attached to the outside of instrument.  The new supply will effectively bypass the broken circuit elements.  Power to the HRC will be restored by powering the existing electronics through the new power supply unit.</P>\r\n<h2>Future Science</h2><p>One of the highest priorities of Servicing Mission 4 is the installation of a powerful new instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), a camera covering wavelengths from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared.  WFC3 has enormous scientific potential, providing high sensitivity over a wide field of view and with a wide range of wavelength coverage.  The capabilities of ACS and WFC3 overlap in some areas; however, each offers some key abilities not provided by the other, and together are wonderfully complementary.</p>\r\n<p>ACS has several unique capabilities that are unmatched by WFC3.  This includes full-field slitless spectroscopy using a very sensitive red grism, and a coronagraph in the high-resolution channel of the ACS.  The latter of these is critical for studying planet formation and evolution around nearby stars.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Links</strong></h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://acs-repair.gsfc.nasa.gov/pubs/ACS_repair_cheng-STScI-Article.pdf\">Fact Sheet</a> (PDF)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n",

The fix is straightforward, but requires diligence  as the instrument was not built with space surgery in mind. Engineers have, therefore, developed a number  of special tools and devices to aid the astronauts and ensure no debris enters  the instrument.</p>\n<p>To begin the repair, astronauts will install a fastener capture plate over the top of the STIS  electronics access panel. This plate must  catch the 111 screw that will be removed in order to access the supply board,  and any small fragments of metal that might escape as a screw is removed.</p>\n<p>After detaching the  panel (with the capture plate and fasteners attached), astronauts will  remove the failed power supply card and click in the new one, much like  replacing a circuit board on a computer. </p>\n<p>A new, simplified panel  is then installed over the open electronics cavity&mdash;only this time the 111  fasteners are not necessary.

Aiming at correcting the optics of its flawed mirror shape and installing new instruments as part of a maintenance plan, the first Servicing Mission (STS-61) to the Hubble Space Telescope was launched in December 1993. Among the seven-member crew was European astronaut Claude Nicollier.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p> The installation of a new device - the COSTAR (Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement) - corrected the flatness problem of the mirror&rsquo;s outer edge (2 microns too flat), which had up until then been responsible for the fuzzy images taken with Hubble.

The goal of this 10-day operation was to enhance Hubble&rsquo;s scientific capabilities for discovery by conducting a number of maintenance tasks and refurbishing the existing systems.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p> STS-82 included the installation of two technologically advanced instruments by a crew of astronauts who reached Hubble aboard the Discovery Space Shuttle. Both devices featured technology that was not available when the first designs of the Hubble Space Telescope were produced.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p> The Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) replaced the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) and the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) respectively.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p> NICMOS has enabled astronomers to dig into the nature of dusty galactic centres and to gain valuable knowledge of star and planet formation. Consisting of three cameras, NICMOS has proven effective at providing infrared and spectroscopic observations of cosmological objects. One of NICMOS&rsquo;s key contributions is having presented the world with the first image of our Universe at near-infrared wavelengths. These wavelengths are not observable to the human eye, but allow us to probe the distant Universe. Endowed with powerful detectors, NICMOS has been able to offer views of our Universe that no other previous optical or ultraviolet device has ever been capable of.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p> STIS was a powerful spectroscopic device sensitive to light in ultraviolet wavelengths. It employed two-dimensional detectors that gather 30 times more spectral data and 500 times more spatial data than the first generation Hubble spectrographs. STIS is considered to be the most complex scientific instrument built for space science. With its high sensitivity and resolution, scientists have studied the distribution of mass across the Universe, star formation in faraway galaxies, and supermassive blackholes.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p> Additionally, astronauts replaced and renewed primary spacecraft hardware:</p>\r\n\t\t  <ul>\r\n            <li> Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS). These optical sensors are part of Hubble&rsquo;s Pointing Control System. As such, they keep Hubble steady while observing objects. Refurbishing the FGS has allowed for alignment corrections from the Earth. They are also employed by scientists to calculate celestial distances. </li>\r\n\t\t    <li>Optical Control Electronics Enhancement Kit (OCE-EK). Used to adjust the Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS), which keep the telescope still and aligned, ensuring that the science instruments produce sharp images. </li>\r\n\t\t    <li>A new type of Solid State Recorder (SSR) replaced one of Hubble&rsquo;s three Engineering Science Tape Recorders (ESTR). SSR is a state-of-the-art digital recorder that stores significantly more data than the old reel-to-reel recorder. </li>\r\n\t\t    <li> Astronauts also replaced one of Hubble&rsquo;s four Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA). This device consists of a set of wheels that moves the telescope from target to target. As such, it is also part of Hubble&rsquo;s Pointing Control System. </li>\r\n\t\t    <li>Replacement of one of Hubble&rsquo;s two sets of Solar Array Drive Electronics (SADE) was also conducted. Such modular hardware controls the position of the solar arrays and is provided by the European Space Agency, NASA&rsquo;s partner in the Hubble project. </li>\r\n\t\t    <li>One of the telescope&rsquo;s four Data Interface Units (DIU) was replaced with an upgraded version. These units receive and send commands and data requests between the telescope&rsquo;s management system and the other subsystems.</li>\r\n\t\t    <li>A tape recorder that stores up to one billion bits of science and engineering data but that cannot be transmitted to the ground in real time was also installed. </li>\r\n\t\t    <li> New Magnetic Sensing System Covers were installed. They enclosed the device responsible for measuring the telescope&rsquo;s orientation relative to the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. </li>\r\n\t\t    <li>Several tears in Hubble&rsquo;s insulation material were repaired with a mixed assortment of unconventional spacewalking tools: parachute cord, Teflon insulation with holders made of Velcro, Teflon-coated copper wire, electrical tie wraps and plastic tie wraps. </li>\r\n\t\t  </ul>\r\n\t\t  <p>The seven-member crew of astronauts who conducted five spacewalks during this mission were equipped with more than 150 crew aids and tools. </p>\r\n\t\t  <p><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\t\t  <p><strong> Links</strong></p>\r\n\t\t  <p><a href=\"http://hubble.nasa.gov/multimedia/results.php?mission=SM2%20:%20STS-82\"> Images of STS-82 </a></p>\r\n\t\t  <p><a href=\"http://hubble.nasa.gov/missions/sm2.php\"> NASA&rsquo;s description of STS-82 (SM2) </a></p>\r\n\t\t  </td>\r\n\t\t<td width=\"24%\" valign=\"top\"><p><img src=\"/static/about/img/s82e5175.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"140\" alt=\"Hubble after capture with the remote manipulator arm.

However, urgency to address the failure of Hubble&rsquo;s third gyroscope led NASA managers to split SM3 into two parts (SM3A and SM3B), scheduling an early servicing mission (SM3A) for December 1999.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p> The unexpected failure of the fourth of Hubble&rsquo;s six gyroscopes on 13 November 1999, with SM3A already planned, caused NASA to place Hubble into safe mode. Unable to conduct science without at least three working gyros, Hubble went into a sort of protective hibernation until 19 December 1999, when a crew of astronauts aboard the Discovery Space Shuttle flew to its rescue and replaced all the gyroscopes.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p> Since the second Servicing Mission in February 1997, three of the gyroscopes had failed and caused some concern among NASA officials. Additionally, NASA deemed necessary the replacement of one of Hubble&rsquo;s three Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS). Both devices are part of Hubble&rsquo;s advanced pointing control system, and as such, they keep the telescope steady during observations.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p> During the 8-day flight, astronauts conducted several other crucial servicing and upgrading tasks, which involved the installation of several other instruments:</p>\r\n\t\t\t<ul>\r\n              <li> Advanced computer (486 model). The replacement of the spacecraft&rsquo;s computer decreased the financial burden of flight software maintenance. It was also 20 times faster with six times more memory than the old one.</li>\r\n\t\t\t  </ul>\r\n\t\t\t<ul>\r\n              <li> Voltage/temperature Improvement Kit (VIK). Six of these instruments were replaced in order to protect the batteries from overcharging and overheating when the spacecraft goes into sleep mode. </li>\r\n              <li> A next-generation Solid State Recorder (SSR) replaced one of Hubble&rsquo;s two Engineering Science Tape Recorders (ESTR). SSR allows efficient handling of high-volume data having room for 10 times as much data as the previous one.</li>\r\n              <li> A new S-Band Single Access Transmitter (SSAT) was also installed. This device sends data from the telescope to the ground.</li>\r\n              <li> Hubble&rsquo;s outer layers of thermal protection were replaced. The New Outer Blanket Layer (NOBL) and the Shell/Shield Replacement Fabric (SSRF) protect the telescope from the drastic and rapid temperature changes Hubble undergoes during each 90 minute orbit while it progresses from sunlight to darkness. </li>\r\n\t\t\t  </ul>\r\n\t\t\t<p> Led by Servicing Mission veterans Steven Smith and Michael Foale, the seven-member crew aboard the Discovery Space Shuttle (STS-103) left for outer space on 19 December 1999. Working in pairs on four alternating days, the astronauts staged three space-walks and renewed the observatory.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p> After preliminary tests had shown that all systems - new as well as old - were performing perfectly, Hubble was released with the Shuttle&rsquo;s robotic arm. This was followed by Discovery backing slowly away from the telescope.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p> Upon successful equipment replacement and maintenance upgrades of Hubble, the astronauts used their remaining time in space to stow equipment away as well as making other preparations before embarking on the journey back to Earth.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p> On 27 December 1999, performing a smoothly night-time landing, Discovery touched down on the runway at the Kennedy Space Center in the United States.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p> During the mission, the Discovery Space Shuttle circled the Earth 119 times and travelled more than 5 million kilometres. Among the 7-member crew was ESA&rsquo;s Claude Nicollier, who staged the mission&rsquo;s second spacewalk accompanied by NASA&rsquo;s Michael Foale.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p> While awaiting the next servicing mission (SM3B) scheduled in March 2002, Hubble was ready for further scientific observations and new discoveries. <br />\r\n\t\t\t  <br />\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong> Links</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t  <li> Read more on ESA&rsquo;s live coverage of SM3A: <a href=\"/about/history/sm3a_live_coverage/\">/about/history/sm3a_live_coverage/</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t  <li> ESA Servicing Mission 3A Newspaper &ndash; English: <a href=\"/static/pressroom/presskits/sts103_english.pdf\">/static/pressroom/presskits/sts103_english.pdf</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t  <li> ESA Servicing mission 3A Newspaper &ndash; French: <a href=\"/static/pressroom/presskits/sts103_french.pdf\">/static/pressroom/presskits/sts103_french.pdf</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t  <li> ESA Servicing Mission 3A Newspaper &ndash; German: <a href=\"/static/pressroom/presskits/sts103_german.pdf\">/static/pressroom/presskits/sts103_german.pdf</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t  <li> NASA SM3A site: <a href=\"http://sm3a.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">http://sm3a.gsfc.nasa.gov/</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t  <li> NASA&rsquo;s description of STS-103 (SM3A): <a href=\"http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-103/mission-sts-103.html\">http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-103/mission-sts-103.html</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t  <li> Images of STS-103 (SM3A): <a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-103/ndxpage1.html\">http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-103/ndxpage1.html</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t  </ul>\t\t\t<p><br />\r\n\t\t        <br />\r\n\t\t        </p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t<td width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\"><p><img src=\"/static/about/img/sts103s005.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"251\" alt=\" The long awaited launch of Discovery from Cape Canaveral marking the beginning of Servicing Mission 3A.\" /></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\t\t\t\t<em>The long-awaited launch of Discovery from Cape Canaveral marking the beginning of Servicing Mission 3A.</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em><img src=\"/static/about/img/s103e5162.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"253\" alt=\"Hubble has just been &quot;grappled&quot; by ESA astronaut Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Clervoy.

Left unable to perform science operations, NASA split the third servicing mission in two separate flights: SM3A and SM3B.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p> Upon successful completion of SM3A - marked by the replacement of Hubble&rsquo;s gyroscopes - in December of 1999, the fourth servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope was launched on 1 March 2002.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p> In preparation for this mission, the 7-astronaut Columbia crew (STS-109) underwent a training period that included extensive cross tuition and required that all astronauts received specific rehearsals tailored to their assigned tasks.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p> Led by Commander Scott D. Altman, the crew flew aboard the Columbia Space Shuttle to the space telescope and conducted a number of extra vehicle activities to upgrade the spacecraft. The nearly 12-day mission featured five spacewalks and the installation of new science instruments.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p> Crucial to putting Hubble at the &ldquo;apex&rdquo; of its capabilities was the installation of a new scientific instrument - the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) - containing advanced technology that far surpassed what had been available to the telescope to date.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p> The ACS replaced the old camera and brought 10 times more discovery power and so collected 10 times more data than the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 in the same span of time. With a wide field of view, high image quality and extraordinary sensitivity, Hubble&rsquo;s ACS enhanced the spacecraft&rsquo;s capabilities from visible to far ultraviolet. The ACS enabled to capture the most distant image of our Universe called the Hubble Deep Field, which has helped astronomers unveil the deepest and farthest mysteries of our Universe.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p> Albeit the principal task was the installation of the ACS, several other key upgrading activities were also conducted:</p>\r\n\t\t  <ul>\r\n            <li> The 8-year old solar array panels were replaced with smaller rigid ones that produce 30 percent more power. </li>\r\n            <li> The outdated Power Control Unit was replaced. The PCU is used to distribute electricity from the solar arrays and batteries to other parts of the telescope. </li>\r\n            <li> One of the four reaction wheel assemblies that make up Hubble&rsquo;s pointing control system was also exchanged. </li>\r\n            <li> Another important upgrade was the installation of a new cooling system for the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), which had been down since 1999 after depleting its refrigerant. With this upgrade, Hubble regained its infrared vision. </li>\r\n            <li> Astronauts fitted Hubble&rsquo;s exterior with several specially coated sheets - New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs) - that prevent damage from sunlight and severe temperature changes and help maintain Hubble's normal operating temperature.</li>\r\n\t\t    </ul>\r\n\t\t  <p> After numerous refurbishing and maintenance tasks during this mission, astronauts left Hubble ready to achieve its full potential and to continue revolutionising modern astronomy by carrying out new observations and delivering unseen views of our Universe.</p>\r\n\t\t  <p> Hubble&rsquo;s latest upgrades at a glance:</p>\r\n\t\t  <ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li> <a href=\"/about/general/instruments/acs/\">ACS - A new digital camera to extend Hubble's vision</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t    <li><a href=\"/about/history/sm3b_new_solar_panels/\">New solar panels</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t    <li><a href=\"/about/history/sm3b_replacement_of_pcu/\">Replacement of the Power Control Unit</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t    <li><a href=\"/about/history/sm3b_nicmos_returns/\">Nicmos returns!</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t    <li><a href=\"/about/history/sm3b_a_new_coat/\">A new coat for the telescope</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t    <li><a href=\"/about/history/sm3b_a_little_boost/\">A little boost </a></li>\r\n\t\t\t</ul>\t\t\t<p>Hubble was released from the Shuttle 9 March 9:32 CET.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h2>Links</h2>\r\n\t\t\t<ul><li>Meet the <a href=\"/about/history/sm3b_astronauts/\">astronauts</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t    <li><a href=\"http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-109/mission-sts-109.html\">NASA's description of SM3B (STS-109)</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t    <li><a href=\"http://adcam.pha.jhu.edu/\">More about ACS</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t    <li><a href=\"http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-90/vrtour/\">NASA's Virtual Tour of Space Shuttle Columbia</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t</ul></td>\r\n\t\t<td width=\"38%\" valign=\"top\"><p><img src=\"/static/about/img/sm3b_hst1.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"160\" alt=\"The clock is ticking down for the next Hubble Servicing Mission.\" /></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>The clock is ticking down for the next Hubble Servicing Mission.</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em><img src=\"/static/about/img/sm3bgrapple.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"132\" alt=\"From the very beginning Hubble was designed to be astronaut-friendly.\" /></em></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>From the very beginning Hubble was designed to be astronaut-friendly.</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"/static/about/img/sts103_713_048_200.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"205\" alt=\"Hubble berthed in the Space Shuttle bay during Servicing Mission 3A.\" /></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>Hubble berthed in the Space Shuttle bay during Servicing Mission 3A.</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em><img src=\"/static/about/img/img0038.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\" alt=\"One of the SM3B astronauts during underwater tank training.\" /></em></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>One of the SM3B astronauts during underwater tank training.</em></p></td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n",

There are two cameras, one spectrograph and a set of fine guidance sensors.</strong></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/static/about/img/heic0202a.jpg\" alt=\"Hubble gets revitalised in new servicing mission\" width=\"320\" height=\"226\" hspace=\"10\" vspace=\"10\" align=\"right\" />Hubble was designed to be serviced in space, thus also allowing outdated instruments to be replaced. The telescope was placed into a low-Earth orbit by the Space Shuttle (600 km altitude) and was designed using modular components so that on subsequent Shuttle missions it could be recovered and faulty or outdated parts more easily replaced before being re-released into orbit.</p>\r\n<p>Power for the computers and scientific instruments onboard is provided by two 2.6 x 7.1 m solar panels.

Should work for both PC and Macintosh [OSX; OS9 would be nice \r\n                but not as crucial] platforms.<br />\r\n                2. Should recognize all standard file endings (.fit .FIT .fits \r\n                .FITS).<br />\r\n                3. Should be implemented as a standard file I/O plug that allows \r\n                the file to be double-clicked and automatically launch Photoshop \r\n                and activate the plugin. <br />\r\n                4. Should be able to open all normal types of FITS files, regardless \r\n                of bit-depth (8, 16, 24...) and variable type (integer, real ...) \r\n                <br />\r\n                5. For x-dimensional FITS data cubes, it should allow user to \r\n                select which channel to import. 3D FITS cubes are common in radio/millimeter \r\n                spectral line work. There is an NAXIS keyword which is 2 if it's \r\n                a flat image file and 3 if it's an image cube. Now if for instance \r\n                HST uses NAXIS = 3 and NAXIS3 = 4 (indicating 4 stacked images) \r\n                then one should be able to pick out which image plane one wants.<br />\r\n                6. Should scan the contents of the FITS file to identify the full \r\n                min/max range of values in the image.<br />\r\n                7. Should be able to set the z1 (black level) and z2 (white level) \r\n                cuts using either sliders or numeric entry; initial guess should \r\n                be set to the image min/max values.<br />\r\n                8. Transfer functions should be chosen with radio buttons (or \r\n                a drop-down list): linear, log, sqrt, sqrt (log), log(log). Some \r\n                transfer functions needs to be applied with appropriate offsets \r\n                &#8211; log does not like input values below 1, and sqrt not below \r\n                0. It may be possible to find these offsets automatically based \r\n                on the min/max values although this is easier said than done due \r\n                to the occasional &#8216;weird&#8217; values due to CCD chip defects. \r\n                The easiest may be to have an offset input option for the user.<br />\r\n                9. Should be able to handle very large datasets as memory-efficiently \r\n                as possible. Since input FITS files could in principle be very \r\n                large, it might be necessary to have ways of disabling certain \r\n                features of the plug-in that slow it down too much (as noted in \r\n                the preview pane discussion below). <br />\r\n                10. Should be able to choose between 8-bit and 16-bit channel \r\n                depth for Photoshop import. <br />\r\n                11. Should have a fairly large preview pane (~500 pix, with ~50 \r\n                pix black frame) to show image after z1, z2 cuts and transfer \r\n                function have been applied. <br />\r\n                12. Should get the top/bottom orientation correct. The row ordering \r\n                of FITS files is typically opposite of most other image formats; \r\n                &quot;raw&quot; reads usually require the image to be flipped \r\n                vertically.<br />\r\n                13. Have the plugin retain the previous import settings if the \r\n                same file as last time is read in again (e.g. make it possible \r\n                to repeat the import and easily tweak the settings if you have \r\n                to do it again).</p>\r\n              <p><br />\r\n                <strong>Value-Added Features </strong></p>\r\n              <p>The following elements represent very useful functionalities \r\n                but may entail programming overheads that may make some number \r\n                of them impractical to implement. They are ordered roughly in \r\n                increasing complexity. </p>\r\n              <p>1. Should correctly identify &quot;blank&quot; values and not \r\n                confuse them with real data values . We are not sure if this is \r\n                possible, but these values are generally not 0. The idea is to \r\n                differentiate between 0 values and non-existent data (like the \r\n                edges of a field that has been reprojected into a different coordinate \r\n                system). In some radio data there is a FITS keyword that specifies \r\n                a &quot;magic blanking&quot; value (e.g. a specific number that \r\n                is to be treated as missing data).<br />\r\n                2. Should have an option to set &quot;blanked&quot; values to \r\n                0, another integer level, or &quot;transparent&quot; (this last \r\n                feature may be possible in PS 8.0). <br />\r\n                3. For x-dimensional FITS data cubes, the user should be able \r\n                to select a range of channels to import as either separate documents \r\n                or separate layers within a document (all would use the same z1/z2 \r\n                and transform).<br />\r\n                4. Once the full range of the input FITS data have been determined, \r\n                the data values should be graphed in a histogram (x &#8211; greyscale \r\n                value, y &#8211; number). The sliders for min/max cuts should \r\n                appear under this histogram (similar to the Photoshop &quot;Levels&quot; \r\n                command).<br />\r\n                5. The histogram distribution should dynamically update depending \r\n                on choice of transfer function (this perhaps would appear in a \r\n                second window since the distribution for non-linear functions \r\n                will change depending on the z1/z2 choices ). The distribution \r\n                of brightness for a sqrt or log function will vary strongly with \r\n                the black point z1 choice, changing the overall shape of the histogram.<br />\r\n                6. Should have a simple function parser to allow custom transfer \r\n                functions to be defined and applied, e.g. &quot;out_im = log(in_im \r\n                + 3)&quot;.<br />\r\n                7. Features of the preview window could include: <br />\r\n                o Checkbox to disable preview (if it slows down the process too \r\n                much).<br />\r\n                o Zooming and panning within the preview.<br />\r\n                o Crosshair in preview pane that reads out FITS pixel values into \r\n                an info box.<br />\r\n                o The preview could be implemented as a sub-sampled image constructed \r\n                when the FITS file is first read, to prevent having to re-reference \r\n                the original FITS file during adjustments and thereby save time. \r\n                This may make it harder to zoom, however.<br />\r\n                8. Read the header info (incl. WCS (World Coordinate System)) \r\n                and make that information available in some useful form in the \r\n                Photoshop resource.<br />\r\n                9. If possible be able to use the Plug-in in Photoshop 7 and Elements.</p>\r\n              <p>v. 1.0/160403<br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              ",

From  its privileged position above the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere Hubble has been able to  contribute significantly to this area of research. All over the Universe stars  work as giant reprocessing plants taking light chemical elements and  transforming them into heavier ones. The original, so-called primordial,  composition of the Universe is studied in such fine detail because it is one of  the keys to our understanding of processes in the very early Universe.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><em><strong>Helium in the early Universe</strong></em><br />\r\n      Shortly after the First Servicing Mission successfully corrected the spherical  aberration in Hubble&rsquo;s mirror a team led by European astronomer Peter Jakobsen  investigated the nature of the gaseous matter that fills the vast volume of  intergalactic space. By observing ultraviolet light from a distant quasar,  which would otherwise have been absorbed by the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, they found  the long-sought signature of helium in the early Universe. This was an  important piece of supporting evidence for the Big Bang theory.

Now anyone with a desktop computer running Adobe&reg; Photoshop&reg; software can try their hand at crafting astronomical images as beautiful as those from the Hubble Space Telescope. This free software plug-in, makes a treasure trove of archival astronomical images from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, the European Space Agency&rsquo;s XMM-Newton X-ray observatory, NASA&rsquo;s Spitzer Space Telescope, NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and many other famous telescopes accessible to home astronomy enthusiasts. </p>\r\n              <p>Version 2 of the FITS Liberator has been improved in several areas, some of which are: </p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li> FITS images with up to 4 billion greyscales can be processed (32 bit support). </li>\r\n                <li> FITS images with up to 500 million pixels or more can be processed (100 times larger than standard images from a digital camera). </li>\r\n                <li> With a re-designed workflow and improved user interface, it is easier to use. The plug-in for instance remembers previous settings. </li>\r\n                <li>  With the new options for advanced scaling and stretching, the images can be tuned and tweaked for optimal results. </li>\r\n                <li>  A whole section of the plug-in is dedicated to inputting metadata, i.e. information about the image and what it shows. Metadata will be important for future efforts to make archives of &lsquo;pretty pictures&rsquo; better accessible. </li>\r\n                <li> The user has access to a text version of the original FITS header. </li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p>Apart from the great advantages of an interactive workflow, the Liberator enables creation of images with improved quality as the many greyscales in the original observations are preserved.

The reason being that important clues about our  genesis lie hidden behind the veil of the <a href=\"/images/heic0506b/\">dusty</a>, and  often <a href=\"/images/heic0105a/\">very  beautiful</a>, star forming <a href=\"/images/heic0305a/\">molecular  clouds</a>. Our Earth and the Solar System were born 4.6 billion years ago and  our knowledge of the event is sparse. Astronomers turn their eyes to the birth  of other stars and stellar systems in neighbouring stellar &lsquo;maternity wards&rsquo;  and use these as a time machine to see a replay of the events that created our  own Solar System.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>Inside the  Orion Nebula </em></strong><br />\r\n                The <a href=\"/images/heic0601a/\">large  mosaic</a> of 15 Hubble images showing the central part of the Orion complex is  one of the most detailed images of a star forming region ever made. It shows a  very young star cluster blowing a &lsquo;bubble&rsquo; in its remnant parent cloud of  glowing gas so that the stars start to be seen in visible light &ndash; like the  smoke in a forest fire being driven away by the heat.<br />\r\n              Hubble&rsquo;s  high resolution has been crucial in the investigation of the dust disks, dubbed  proplyds, around the newly born stars in the Orion Nebula. The &lsquo;proplyds&rsquo; may  very well be young planetary systems in the early phases of their creation. The  details that are revealed are better than what has been achieved with  ground-based instruments, and thanks to Hubble we have today visual proof that  dusty disks around young stars are common.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Peering through dust<br />\n</em></strong>Since  star birth always seems to take place in dusty environments, Hubble&rsquo;s infrared  capabilities have been a very important factor. The infrared instrument NICMOS  can peer through large parts of the dust and reveal the complex processes taking  place in the star forming regions. Otherwise invisible close double and  multiple stars were discovered, as well as faint substellar brown dwarf  companions. With NICMOS and its visual counterpart <a href=\"/about/general/instruments/wfpc2/\">WFPC2</a>,  Hubble has observed giant <a href=\"/images/heic0707b/\">jets of  material spewing out from infant stars</a> surrounded by large disks of dust.

These images showed many galaxies, which  were often quite unlike those we see in the local Universe and could not  otherwise be studied using conventional ground-based telescopes. The first Deep  Field, the Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N), was observed over 10 consecutive  days during Christmas 1995. The <a href=\"/images/opo9601c1/\">resulting image</a> consisted of 342 separate exposures, with a total exposure time of more than  100 hours, compared with typical Hubble exposures of a few hours. The observed  region of sky in Ursa Major was carefully selected to be as empty as possible  so that Hubble would look far beyond the stars of our own Milky Way and out  past nearby galaxies.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The results  were astonishing! Almost 3000 galaxies were seen in the image. Scientists analyzed  the image statistically and found that the HDF had seen back to the very young  Universe where the bulk of the galaxies had not, as yet, had time to form  stars. Or, as the popular press dramatically reported, &ldquo;Hubble sees back to Big  Bang&rdquo;. These very remote galaxies also seemed to be smaller and more irregular  than those nearby. This was taken as a clear indication that galaxies form by  gravitational coalescence of smaller parts. <br />\r\n  In 1996 it  was decided to observe a second Deep Field, the <a href=\"/images/opo9841d/\">Hubble Deep  Field South</a> (HDF-S), to assess whether the HDF-N was indeed a special area  and thus not representative of the Universe as a whole. This time the field  also contained a quasar, which was used as a cosmological lighthouse and  provided valuable information about the matter between the quasar and the  Earth.<br />\n</p>\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><p class=\"style3\"><strong>Stefano Cristiani<br />\n</strong>Space Telescope-European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF)</p> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"7%\"><span class=\"style3\"></span></td>\n<td width=\"86%\"><span class=\"style3\"><em>&quot;In my view the Hubble Deep Fields are some of the images that have made the greatest impact on \r\n\t\t\tobservational cosmology so far.

A planetary nebula.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p align=\"left\">Most of the light and radiation we can observe in the Universe  originates in stars &ndash; individual stars, clusters of stars, nebulae lit by stars  and galaxies composed of billions of stars. Stars are spheres of glowing  hydrogen and other chemical elements which produce their prodigious energy  output by converting lighter elements to heavier ones through nuclear processes  similar to those in hydrogen bombs. Like human beings they are born, mature and  eventually die but their lifetimes are vastly longer than our own. Hubble has  gone beyond what can be achieved by other observatories by linking together  studies of the <a href=\"/news/heic0707/\">births</a>, <a href=\"/images/archive/category/stars/\">lives</a> and <a href=\"/news/heic0703/\">deaths</a> of individual stars with theories of stellar evolution. In particular Hubble&rsquo;s  ability to probe stars in other galaxies enables scientists to investigate the  influence of different environments on the lives of stars. This is crucial in  order to be able to complement our understanding of the Milky Way galaxy with  that of <a href=\"/images/archive/category/galaxies/\">other  galaxies</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>Uncovering the Galaxy&rsquo;s stellar nurseries</em></strong><br />\r\nAnother area where Hubble&rsquo;s work has been widely acknowledged is the linking of  star formation with stellar evolution. Hubble&rsquo;s infrared instrument, <a href=\"/about/general/instruments/nicmos/\">NICMOS,</a> is capable of looking through the dust surrounding newly born stars. Some of  the most surprising discoveries so far have come about by peering through the  clouds of dust surrounding the centre of our Milky Way. Astronomers found that  this centre, which was thought to be a calm and almost &lsquo;dead&rsquo; region, is in  fact populated with <a href=\"/news/heic0104/\">massive infant  stars</a> gathered into clusters.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><br />\n<img src=\"/static/archives/images/medium/heic0206c.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" /><br />\n<em>The Cone Nebula</em><br />\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong><em>Stellar skeletons</em></strong><br />\r\n  The last phases of solar-like stars have been investigated through observations  of <a href=\"/news/heic0307/\">planetary  nebulae</a> and <a href=\"http://www.spacetelescope.org/bin/news.pl?embargo=0&amp;viewtype=standard&amp;searchtype=freesearch&amp;lang=en&amp;string=proto-planetary+nebulae\">proto-planetary  nebulae</a>. These are colourful shells of gas expelled into space by dying  stars. The varying shapes and colours of these intricate structures with  different colours tracing different, often newly created, chemical elements,  have shown that the final stages of the lives of stars are more complex than  once thoughtHubble  was the first telescope to <a href=\"/news/heic0608/\">directly observe  white dwarfs in globular star clusters</a>. White dwarfs are stellar remnants  and provide a &lsquo;fossil&rsquo; record of their progenitor stars which shone so brightly  that they long ago exhausted their nuclear fuel. Through these measurements it  is possible to determine the ages of these ancient clusters which is an  important cosmological tool.<br />\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Supernovae</em></strong><br />\r\n  Most scientists today believe that the expansion of the Universe is  accelerating. This result came from combined measurements of remote supernov&aelig;  with most of the world&rsquo;s top-class telescopes, including Hubble, and it was a  very surprising one. Hubble has given these supernovae measurements an added  precision, mostly due to its high resolution. <br />\n<em><br />\n</em><strong><em>Gamma Ray Bursts</em></strong><br />\r\n  Gamma Ray Bursts emit very intense gamma-ray radiation for short periods and  are observed a few times per day by special gamma-ray detectors on  observatories in space. Today, partly due to Hubble, we know that these bursts  originate in other galaxies - often at very large distances. Their origin has  eluded scientists for a long time, but, after Hubble observations of the  atypical supernova SN1998bw and the <a href=\"/news/heic0003/\">Gamma Ray Burst  GRB 980425</a> a physical connection of these became probable.</p>\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tr align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n<td width=\"25%\"><a href=\"/images/opo9923b/\"><img src=\"/static/archives/images/thumbs/opo9923b.jpg\" alt=\"Newly born massive stars in the Papillon Nebula \" hspace=\"0\" vspace=\"0\" border=\"0\" /></a></td>\n<td width=\"25%\"><a href=\"/images/heic9910a/\"><img src=\"/static/archives/images/thumbs/heic9910a.jpg\" alt=\"The Eskimo Nebula.

With more \r\n                than 500,000 copies distributed, this DVD movie is probably the \r\n                most widely available science documentary ever.</p>\r\n              <p>The movie Chapters and individual clips are available <a href=\"/videos/?search=%2215+years+of+discovery%22\">here</a>.</p>\r\n              <p>Hubble's spectacular visual images make a stunning backdrop throughout \r\n                the film, bringing an immediacy and vitality as the narrative \r\n                reveals the new insights Hubble has inspired in all fields of \r\n                astronomy from exoplanets to black holes. Complex though the science \r\n                behind the telescope&#8217;s images often is, Art Director Martin \r\n                Kornmesser has developed a unique style of elaborate 3D animation \r\n                that enhances and vividly clarifies the underlying science.</p>\r\n              <p>The movie is presented by an ESA scientist, Dr. Robert (Bob) \r\n                Fosbury, who has himself used Hubble for his own research on many \r\n                occasions.</p>\r\n              <p>The 83-minute film DVD contains more than 60 minutes of bonus \r\n                material and has narration in three languages: English, German \r\n                and Greek. In addition, there are subtitles in 15 languages: Bulgarian, \r\n                Danish, English, German, Greek, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, \r\n                Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Finnish and Swedish.</p>\r\n              <p>The film can be requested by TV broadcasters on Betacam SP or \r\n                DVD without cost.

It \r\n                  shows how the imported image will look with the chosen combination \r\n                  of Stretch function (8 + 9) and Black/White level (14). The \r\n                  coloured pixels are due to (6), see this below.</li>\r\n                <li>You may zoom up to 400% on the preview image, and down to \r\n                  6.3% (depending on the size of the image). Default is a zoom \r\n                  factor that lets you view the entire image. </li>\r\n                <li>Some FITS files have several &quot;Images&quot; embedded or \r\n                  stacked on top of each other. And some FITS files also have \r\n                  several &quot;Planes&quot; in them. With this drop-down box \r\n                  you can select which Image or Plane to work on. If you want \r\n                  to import more than one Image or Plane you have to open the \r\n                  file multiple times. Default is Image 1, Plane 1.</li>\r\n                <li>The &quot;Image statistics&quot; box give you information \r\n                  about the Dimensions of the image (in pixels), the Minimum and \r\n                  Maximum pixel values, the Mean and Standard Deviations of the \r\n                  pixel values. If you move the cursor over the preview you will \r\n                  get information about the individual pixels (position and value). \r\n                  The Image Statistics box is updated when you choose another \r\n                  Stretch function (8).</li>\r\n                <li>If you want to perform several operations on an image and \r\n                  work with large images (or a slow computer) you can turn the \r\n                  preview off, and get all your choices calculated at once when \r\n                  you are done and click it back on. Default is Preview On.</li>\r\n                <li>You have a choice of getting three special types of pixel \r\n                  values marked individually with each their colour: Undefined \r\n                  values, White clipped values and Black clipped values. \r\n                  <ul>\r\n                    <li>Undefined values are both so-called NULL values and 'real' \r\n                      undefined values. NULL values are values that are blank \r\n                      in the original FITS file. Undefined values are values that \r\n                      become undefined due to mathematical problems (e.g. division \r\n                      by zero) in the calculation of stretch function etc. Having \r\n                      these values marked is important as too many undefined pixels \r\n                      makes an image look less attractive.</li>\r\n                    <li>White clipped pixels are pixels that are completely white. \r\n                      You can adjust their number using the White level slider \r\n                      (14). </li>\r\n                    <li>Black clipped pixels are pixels that are completely black. \r\n                      You can adjust their number using the Black level slider \r\n                      (14). </li>\r\n                  </ul>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>You have a choice of scaling the graphical viewing of the \r\n                  histogram values (12) in Logarithmic was (default) or linear. \r\n                  Logarithmic usually gives the best overview as the number of \r\n                  pixels with certain intensities vary a lot.</li>\r\n                <li>The stretch function is the 'mapping' of your input image \r\n                  to the output image. The default is Linear and this maps the \r\n                  input image to the output image directly 1:1 without changing \r\n                  anything. If you apply for instance a logarithm the fainter \r\n                  areas of the input image gets enhanced.</li>\r\n                <li> The value a is a constant that offsets the image values. \r\n                  This can be important when you use a logarithmic stretch as \r\n                  Log for instance does not work on negative pixel values.</li>\r\n                <li>You can choose to import the image as an 8-bit image (256 \r\n                  greyscales) or a 16 bit image (65536 greyscales). Note: Photoshop \r\n                  7.0 only has 15 bit support (32767 greyscales) and Photoshop \r\n                  Elements 2 only has 8 bit support. </li>\r\n                <li>If there are Null values in your image you can choose between \r\n                  having them imported as black or transparent. Note: Photoshop \r\n                  7.0 doesn't have support for transparent in 15 bit.</li>\r\n                <li>The histogram shows the distribution of intensities. The higher \r\n                  the bars the more pixels there are of a given value.</li>\r\n                <li>The Apply button applies your typed-in values. Note: Do not \r\n                  use ENTER (Windows only) as this will make Photoshop import \r\n                  the image immediately .</li>\r\n                <li>With the Black and White level sliders you can adjust where \r\n                  you want to set the black and white levels of the imported image \r\n                  within the min/max range. The higher you set the black level \r\n                  the more pixels will appear black. The lower you set the white \r\n                  level the more pixels will appear white.

Designing web sites \r\n                that are both user friendly and easy to maintain is a real challenge. \r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>Here we describe the ideas behind Spacetelescope.org, the new \r\n                public and press web site for the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope \r\n                in Europe, and the general structure and workings of Simplicity, \r\n                an innovative scheme for producing web sites which we developed \r\n                to build Spacetelescope.org. </p>\r\n              <p>Simplicity provides an efficient alternative to existing commercial \r\n                content management systems and is free for everyone to use.</p>\r\n              <p><br />\r\n                <strong>The web was not a fad...</strong><br />\r\n                A recent billboard advertisement read <em>&#8220;The web wasn&#8217;t \r\n                just a passing fad&#8221;</em>. No one would argue with that statement. \r\n                In science communication the web is one of the most frequently \r\n                used ways of distributing popular information about science to \r\n                the media, the public and decision makers today. Although the \r\n                web is still more of a &#8216;professional medium&#8217;, it is \r\n                also increasingly a layman&#8217;s tool. For several years the \r\n                web has been the preferred tool for journalists to conduct story \r\n                research and therefore a proper web site must be a very high priority \r\n                for any public information office. <br />\r\n                The European outreach and education office for both the Hubble \r\n                Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, the Hubble \r\n                European Space Agency Information Centre (HEIC), has existed since \r\n                1999 to disseminate public information about these two missions. \r\n                More details about our work can be found on the web at: <a href=\"/about_us/\">/about_us/</a></p>\r\n              <p>At HEIC we see the web as an excellent tool for the distribution \r\n                of outreach products and for product archiving (as a repository), \r\n                while also providing a service that is available at any time as \r\n                well as a search engine for the rapid retrieval of relevant material. \r\n                The most critical issue for us is time management &#8212; an efficient \r\n                outreach office needs to spend most of its time producing material, \r\n                and very little time on actually distributing it.</p>\r\n              <p>Early in 2004 we began designing our new web site and we naturally \r\n                wanted to exploit the positive features of the web and to produce \r\n                a web site that fulfilled our particular needs for efficiency. \r\n                We quickly realized that the need to reduce manpower consumption \r\n                for web maintenance was a general one and we extended our methodology \r\n                into a general scheme for building efficient web sites. A scheme \r\n                we now offer to the community.</p>\r\n              <p>The result of our efforts is the new public and press web site \r\n                for the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope in Europe and the web \r\n                scheme Simplicity that combines ease of use for visitors with \r\n                a simple and effective strategy for maintenance.</p>\r\n              <p><br />\r\n                <strong>Put yourself in the place of others</strong><br />\r\n                Targeting a website to its primary customers is essential to make \r\n                it successful, and the front page of a web site is undoubtedly \r\n                the most important page of all. In our preparations for an effective \r\n                front page we devised a so-called &#8220;Front page priority matrix&#8221; \r\n                where we collected an overview of different target groups. The \r\n                importance of different elements on the page was assessed &#8212; \r\n                with us trying to imagine the preferences of the target group \r\n                in question. Following this we gave each of the groups effective \r\n                weights calculated from how big a target group they represent \r\n                and from their &#8216;importance&#8217; (as judged by our own \r\n                particular criteria).</p>\r\n              <table width=\"204\" height=\"60\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"2\">\r\n                <tr> \r\n                  <td width=\"200\"><a href=\"/static/projects/img/priomatrix.jpg\"><img src=\"/static/projects/img/priomatrix_small.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"156\" border=\"1\" /></a></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr> \r\n                  <td>Front page priority matrix</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n              </table>\r\n              <p>The study of this matrix led to the following conclusions:</p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li> A simple page overview is the most important.</li>\r\n                <li> News must have top priority.</li>\r\n                <li> Hubble images have to be prominent.</li>\r\n                <li> We can&#8217;t allocate excessive space for flash animations.</li>\r\n                <li> We can&#8217;t allocate excessive space for design components.</li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p>We ended up with the design for the front page seen in Figure \r\n                1. For us this is the compromise between efficiency, searchability, \r\n                science, visual appeal, &#8216;action&#8217; and overview that \r\n                we think caters for the needs of most target groups and the most \r\n                important users.</p>\r\n              <p>For Spacetelescope.org there were three main areas of focus in \r\n                the planning phase. Firstly to plan the functionality of the web \r\n                site, then to plan the sitemap &#8212; ie, the structure (files \r\n                and directories) and finally to plan file formats and sizes for \r\n                images and videos &#8212; ie, the structure of the metadata.</p>\r\n              <p>Anyone implementing a web site using the Simplicity scheme that \r\n                is described below will need to go through the same three planning \r\n                steps and to commit one or two days to set up and adapt the Perl \r\n                scripts to specific needs.<br />\r\n                <br />\r\n                Some of the main features of the finished Spacetelescope.org site \r\n                are:</p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li> The complete collection of ESA and NASA Hubble images</li>\r\n                <li> Huge volumes of animations and films (~35 GB)</li>\r\n                <li> Optimal image quality (best available tiff/jpeg files, sizes \r\n                  up to 250 MB)</li>\r\n                <li> Interactive flash applications and </li>\r\n                <li>Last, but not least, a well-functioning hardware, software \r\n                  and network infrastructure.<br />\r\n                </li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p><strong>Requirements for Simplicity &#8211; the web scheme</strong><br />\r\n                Technically the general web site scheme behind Spacetelescope.org \r\n                was built to satisfy several requirements. <br />\r\n                Firstly it will produce user-friendly web sites that are easy \r\n                to navigate, have consistent, attractive designs and are extremely \r\n                fast for the customers. In today&#8217;s information overloaded \r\n                society it is crucial to provide search capabilities that enable \r\n                the user to sift through the vast amounts of information swiftly \r\n                and receive an instant response to each query.</p>\r\n              <p>Secondly the technology behind the site juggles huge data files \r\n                &#8212; images and videos &#8212; (from 10s to 1000s of MB) in \r\n                archives containing thousands of items each represented in up \r\n                to 15-20 different formats (eg, thumbnails, wallpaper, originals \r\n                etc. for the images), without impeding function or maintenance.</p>\r\n              <p>Thirdly the maintenance of the web system is extremely easy. \r\n                Design changes are made in just one place so that the web master \r\n                is not forced to manually update hundreds of pages. Structural \r\n                changes such as the addition of new archives are also possible \r\n                with relatively small changes to the scripts.</p>\r\n              <p>Finally, the website is relatively &#8216;CPU light&#8217; and \r\n                can, on standard server hardware, handle many concurrent visitors.<br />\r\n                Components of the web scheme <br />\r\n                Apart from the data itself (images, videos etc.) Simplicity consists \r\n                of three main components: </p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li>Dreamweaver templates for the &#8216;wrapping&#8217; of the \r\n                  design</li>\r\n                <li>Perl scripts to execute various search and display queries</li>\r\n                <li>Excel, or comma separated, files for the metadata, or information, \r\n                  attached to images, news stories, videos, posters etc.</li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p>Dreamweaver MX is used to edit the html-scripts. Dreamweaver \r\n                is a simple and visual commercial editor that enables the easy \r\n                editing of web pages, and also provides a template scheme. The \r\n                templates define editable areas of a web page, making it possible \r\n                to keep a consistent design on all web pages. Any changes made \r\n                to a template will cascade to all web pages that are based on \r\n                it, and so design changes need only to be made in one place. To \r\n                further ease the maintenance load, so-called nested templates \r\n                are used, which are templates based in turn on another template. \r\n                This makes it possible to define the global design of the website \r\n                in one template and create templates for the different sections \r\n                based on this global template to hold the individual section design \r\n                items and menus.<br />\r\n                <strong>Archives</strong><br />\r\n                One of the pillars of the Simplicity scheme is the concept of \r\n                &#8220;archives&#8221;. An archive can be any collection of data \r\n                and metadata (images and information). The content of an archive \r\n                can be formatted in any way that is needed, and in different ways \r\n                in the different parts of the website. </p>\r\n              <p> \r\n              <table width=\"204\" height=\"60\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"2\">\r\n                <tr> \r\n                  <td width=\"200\" bordercolor=\"1\"><a href=\"/static/projects/img/excelshot.jpg\"><img src=\"/static/projects/img/excelshot_small.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"156\" border=\"1\" /></a></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr> \r\n                  <td><em>Screenshot from a metadata file being edited in Excel.</em></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n              </table></p>\r\n              <p>Instead of using off-the-shelf database solutions that have problems \r\n                dealing with huge files, a large maintenance overhead and a potentially \r\n                slow response time, the choice for Simplicity fell on lightweight \r\n                Perl scripts as the &#8216;engine&#8217; to create the dynamic \r\n                web content. </p>\r\n              <p>In Simplicity the Perl scripts search and show excerpts of the \r\n                archive metadata that are stored in Excel files (in reality comma-delimited \r\n                text files). These files hold all the data for each news item, \r\n                image and video and are edited with Microsoft Excel (or any column-based \r\n                editor). The metadata include the object ID (for instance the \r\n                image filename), title and caption. Excel, although not traditional \r\n                for this type of work, has maintenance-friendly features such \r\n                as spell checking and is familiar and easy to use. </p>\r\n              <p>The Perl scripts can format the data/metadata content of the \r\n                archives in many different ways and also make refined searches \r\n                possible. Other features are also built into the Perl scripts:</p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li>Publishing at a pre-determined time</li>\r\n                <li> Generating static html pages for the data and metadata contents \r\n                  that are changed rarely (news, images, videos etc.)</li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p>Search functions are provided through a freely available search \r\n                engine called &#8220;ht://Dig&#8221; that indexes all web pages \r\n                on a regular basis, and can be customized to fit into the overall \r\n                design. Furthermore a freely available link-checker can be implemented \r\n                into the scheme to make sure that all links on the web site are \r\n                valid.<br />\r\n                Pros and cons<br />\r\n                Why choose a &#8216;home-made&#8217; low-tech solution over one \r\n                of the many content management systems (CMS) (A CMS is a large \r\n                database driven tool that helps to structure information in the \r\n                form of text, images and animations and place it on the web in \r\n                a predefined way) on the market? A CMS can certainly be adapted \r\n                to most common user demands, such as ease of maintenance and a \r\n                consistent design, but when it comes to performance and handling \r\n                of huge image files, we believe most CMS fail. </p>\r\n              <p>In science communication there is an extreme need for flexibility, \r\n                and this implies the fully autonomous control of a web scheme \r\n                and its technical maintenance and flexibility to quickly adapt \r\n                to new ideas. Most CMS do not provide this. In addition most CMS \r\n                do not provide the lightning fast response needed. </p>\r\n              <p>On the down side Simplicity is not a foolproof scheme. No web \r\n                system is ever 100% foolproof, but our scheme is probably more \r\n                open to error, especially when used by non-technical staff. Simplicity \r\n                is also not a multi-user system, in the sense that only one person \r\n                at a time can edit the page design, or update the individual metadata \r\n                files. In a normal outreach office none of these issues should \r\n                present major worries as it is usually staffed with technical \r\n                personnel and there is no need for workflow control, approval \r\n                control and version tracking.</p>\r\n              <p>As a happy side effect, the construction of Simplicity (including \r\n                the implementation of Spacetelescope.org with all its data and \r\n                metadata) only required three man-months of work, compared to \r\n                an estimated two or three times longer for off-the-shelf CMS (with \r\n                less functionality). Some of this time was naturally invested \r\n                in an integral knowledge of the scheme which in the long run will \r\n                contribute towards a reduced total cost of ownership. The total \r\n                implementation costs were about 13 kEuro.</p>\r\n              <p>Simplicity&#8217;s low-tech solution has already proven its performance \r\n                capability. Spacetelescope.org is running on a single Apache web \r\n                server and was able to cope with 2.3 million hits per day (50-60 \r\n                requests/sec peak load) and the delivery of up to 180 GB of data \r\n                per day during the first weeks of operation.</p>\r\n              <p><strong>References</strong></p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li><a href=\"/projects/web/article/\"> /projects/web/article/</a></li>\r\n                <li> <a href=\"/projects/web/article//projects/web\">/projects/web/article//projects/web</a></li>\r\n                <li> Web editor: Dreamweaver &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com\">http://www.macromedia.com</a></li>\r\n                <li> Free search engine: ht://Dig &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.htdig.org\">http://www.htdig.org</a></li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p></p>\r\n              <p><br />\r\n              </p>\r\n              ",
